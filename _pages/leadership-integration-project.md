All of the work you have done in LDRS 591 supports the Master of Arts in Leadership program capstone, the Learning Integration Project (LIP) (LDRS 697/698).  LDRS 591 is the main prerequisite for the culminating activity of the MA in Leadership program, LDRS 697/698.

LDRS 591 is positioned in the first year of your program to strengthen your analytical and writing skills; it will benefit you in your remaining course work.  The course aims to equip you as a scholar-practitioner.

### Goals of LDRS/MAEL 697/698

The LDRS/MAEL 697/698 is the capstone of the Master of Arts in Leadership program.  This course is the vehicle upon which your personal Leadership Competency Development will be framed and documented.

The purpose of LDRS 697/698 is to encourage learners to integrate their learning in the Master of Arts in Leadership and the Master of Arts in Educational Leadership programs and apply the following curriculum themes:  
1)    Transformational servant leadership  
2)    Values based leadership  
3)     Leadership ethics

The process of designing and completing LDRS 697/698 itself is part of the higher order learning process.  LDRS 697/698 is focused on integrating the learning from various courses into a more comprehensive understanding of leadership. Courses will be collectively analyzed and re-evaluated to determine meta-themes to inform a deeper level of scholarly inquiry in the field of leadership.  Furthermore, LDRS 697/698 will ensure that each student is focused on an individualized educational plan as he navigates through each course and learning experience.

LDRS 697/698 consists of three credit hours of work, and represents the final demonstration of a student’s ability to integrate practical program curriculum content and demonstration of MA Lead’s defined leadership competencies: Visioning and Strategic Thinking; Adaptability and Change; Results; Team Leadership; People Development; Innovation; Values and Ethics; Service &amp; Quality Orientation; Relationships &amp; Collaboration; Planning &amp; Organizing; and Higher Ordered Analysis.

You will document your implementation of the goals of LDRS 697/698 through your completion of a series of elements largely negotiated between yourself and your advisor which demonstrate your personal leadership development and the value added to employers.  LDRS 697/698 requires competent use of evidence-based scholarly knowledge, ability to analyze an issue, discipline in the problem-solving process, and scholarly documentation and presentation of information.

##### LDRS/MAEL 697/698 Processes- Praxis

Glanz has described an action research cycle as consisting of six steps:  selecting of a focus, followed by data collection, then data analysis and interpretation, then action based on the data analysis, followed by reflection and then either continuing with, or modification of, the action all leading back to the selection of a new focus (Glanz, 1998, p. 27).   The cycles of action research share a great deal of conceptual overlap with the process known as “praxis.”

Praxis is a transliteration of a Greek word that is focused on both doing and planning (Kittel, Bromiley &amp; Freidreich 1964-1976, p. 632). The Brazilian educator Paulo Freire conceives of praxis as action and reflection (2006, p. 94). He asserts that humans are marked by the results of their actions.  In acting they transform, and in transforming they create an environment that conditions their acting (Freire, 2006).

There is consensus among adult educators that adults learn best by doing. Jane Vella defines praxis as “learning by doing” with “built in reflection”, and includes it as one of her twelve keystones to effective adult learning (1995, p. 33). To Vella, praxis is a kind of dance between inductive and deductive forms of learning, and involves cycles of doing, reflecting, deciding, changing, and new doing.  To the African educator Gichia, praxis is a rhythm between action and reflection, and then further action informed by the reflection (1989, pp. 98-99). By way of illustrating how praxis works, Ted Ward (n.d.) has suggested a rail fence analogy to describe the education of professionals such as you. The elements of his analogy may be diagrammed as follows.

The upper rail is labeled “theory” and refers to cognitive inputs that are part of every educational program.  Ward asserts that cognitive input is basic to competence and excellence.  In the MA in Leadership program, there are a great many cognitive inputs that come to you through a wide range of instructional modes.  The lower rail is labeled “experience.”  Here, experience refers primarily to your personal and professional experiences in life.  Your experiences have no doubt contributed greatly to your learning, including the development of knowledge, the basis for evaluation, and your motivation to continue to learn.

As Ward conceived this model, the upright posts in the fence denoted the places where the learner is able to make a solid connection between theory and practice.  To Ward, the seminar is where the learner has opportunity for the learner to reflect, evaluate and hypothesize as theory and practice are connected.  A good seminar is characterized by making provision for and stimulation to reflect upon and evaluate learnings from both the cognitive inputs of theory and personal experience (Ward, n.d.).  
The Master of Arts in Leadership program is structured in such a way that Ward’s conception of seminars is accomplished throughout the core and stream courses taken and finally in LDRS 697/698 (Leadership Integration Project).  The Leadership Integration Project is intended to be the tangible result of the praxis you engage in where the theory you encounter in the program courses intersects with your experience.  Ideally, your Leadership Integration Project is a report of the action research you have conducted to further your personal professional practice.  Your LDRS 697/698 advisor who will be assigned to you following your completion of LDRS 591 will serve as a fellow-traveler along this path of learning.

##### LDRS/MAEL  697/698  Platform and Processes

In LDRS 697/698 you will, through praxis, propose and implement a Leadership Integration Project that integrates knowledge and experiences gained in the MA Lead program.  In this, you will assemble together diverse aspects of leadership into a focused whole using Boyer’s model of scholarship.

You will be assigned an advisor and a section of LDRS 697/698.  This will function similarly to other courses wherein you will be able to interact with your advisor as well as upload elements of LDRS 697/698 which document your development of your personal leadership competencies through the Leadership Integration Project.  Your LDRS 697/698 Advisor will be assigned to you shortly after completion of LDRS 591.

LDRS/MAEL 697/698 is the capstone individual product of the MA in Leadership program.  In LDRS/MAEL 697/698 through completing the activities you will have opportunity to integrate your learning in the MA in Leadership program and bring together diverse servant leadership practice into a focused whole using higher order thinking skills. LDRS 697/698 is the application of servant leadership theory to your workplace in a scholarly project.
