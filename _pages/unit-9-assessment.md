<h2>Unit 9 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 9 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 9, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):
<h4>Part A</h4>
Create a new blog post and discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What are the similarities and differences in the discussion/conclusion section of a qualitative and quantitative research report?.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part B</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Next, discuss your evaluation of the quality of the discussion/conclusion section in the servant leadership article you chose to focus on?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part C</h4>
We have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>As a consumer of research reports what were the most important aspects you need to consider in the discussion/conclusion section of  of a high-quality research report?</li>
 	<li>Are there any elements of this section that you still have questions about or finding confusing?</li>
 	<li>How can you apply this knowledge to your work context or current leadership experience?</li>
</ul>
Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.

Be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 9</strong>. This helps to organize the class blogs and interactions.
