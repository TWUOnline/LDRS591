<h2>Unit 1 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 1 Blog</h3>
<strong>Expectations for</strong> <strong>Blog posts</strong>

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to create blog posts.  Some of the blog posts do not require a discussion or a response, however, some of the blog posts do require you to close with one question that invites further comments and discussion from your colleagues.  Please do your best to complete the blog posts that require a response by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.

<strong>Replying to Colleagues’ Posts</strong>
<p class="Paragraph">You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues blog posts when a discussion question is posted. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond to a minimum one discussion question during unit 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. <strong> </strong>Feel free to respond to more questions if you want to.<strong>   </strong></p>
In unit 1, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):
<h4>Part 1</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Create a new post, and explain what your experience is with "research". Next, discuss at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader and explain how you made that decision. Make sure to include what type of information you used to base your decision (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 2</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Then, answer the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What factors do you think shape your decision-making process as a leader?</li>
 	<li>Do you agree or disagree with the proposition made in the course notes (by the authors) that one’s worldview influences the types of questions that you ask, and the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions?</li>
 	<li>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 3</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>How did the authors of the articles conceptualize evidence-based leadership?</li>
 	<li>What is considered as "evidence"?</li>
 	<li>In your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important?</li>
 	<li>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 1</strong>. This helps to organize the class blogs and interactions.
<h3>Checking Your Learning</h3>
Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Can you evaluate the philosophical bases for empirical inquiry, including the knowledge claims represented by various approaches to research?</li>
 	<li>Can you appraise the contributions of scholarly inquiry as foundational for evidence-based leadership?</li>
 	<li>Can you distinguish between various domains of scholarship (i.e., discovery, integration, application, and teaching)?</li>
</ol>
Feel free to review topics more in depth or continue on to the next unit.
