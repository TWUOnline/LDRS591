<h3>Unit 3: Developing Your Professional Voice</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>

An essential attribute of scholarly work is that of writing well. Writing well involves several components. Some are conceptual—reasoning and developing a logical argument. Others reflect the mechanics of good written communication—organization of a manuscript, style and language use, grammar, spelling, and punctuation. APA formatting also falls within this category of the mechanics of writing well.

The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted. Unit 3 is devoted to helping you become familiar with some of the more common elements of scholarly writing and APA style.
