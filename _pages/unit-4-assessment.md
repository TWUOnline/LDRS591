<h2>Unit 4 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 4 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 4, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):
<h4>Part A</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>First, create a new blog post and begin by comparing and contrast the elements of a qualitative research question and a quantitative research question.</li>
 	<li>Then, discuss your <strong>evaluation of the statement of the problem</strong> in the servant leadership article you chose to focus on. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part B</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Next, discuss your <strong>evaluation of the literature review</strong> in the article you chose to focus on.  Make sure that you include your quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part C</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Then,  discuss your <strong>evaluation of the purpose statement or research question</strong> in the article you chose to focus on.  Make sure that you include your quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part D</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Finally, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>As a consumer of research reports, what were the most important aspects you need to consider in the introduction section of a high-quality research report?</li>
 	<li>Are there any elements of this section that you still have questions about or finding confusing?</li>
 	<li>How can you apply this knowledge to your work context or current experience?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.</li>
</ul>
Be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 4</strong>. This helps to organized the class blogs and interactions.
