<h3>Unit 2 Learning Activities</h3>
Welcome to Week 2! This week you will be exploring the topic "Accessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature".  This unit will help you develop a research question, gain familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature and help you get a sense of what scholarly sources of information are available, given your own research interests.  In this unit you will also gain first-hand experience in locating and organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature.

The learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials on how to access and evaluate scholarly literature.

&nbsp;
<h3>Topic 1: The Research Process</h3>
Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define research as "a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue" (p. 4). Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) identify eight steps in the research process which provide us with a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies. These steps help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.
<ol>
 	<li>The whole process begins with <strong>identifying the research problem</strong>. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.</li>
 	<li>A <strong>literature review</strong> is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area.This step is the primary focus of this course and involves locating relevant scholarly literature, and analyzing, synthesizing and summarizing what precedent literature has to say about a specific topic.</li>
 	<li>The <strong>purpose of research</strong> includes identifying the objective of a study (e.g., purpose statement). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.</li>
 	<li>Next, it is important to <strong>choose a research design.</strong> This step involves describing an overall plan or approach of the study and also explains the methods used to carry out the plan.</li>
 	<li><strong>Selecting participants and collecting data</strong> includes who will be the participants, how you will collect information from those participants, and what permission you need to obtain in order to collect the information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Analyzing data</strong> involves systematic processes to make sense of the information that has been gathered. We call this process “results,” which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method (e.g., statistics or words).</li>
 	<li><strong>Drawing conclusions</strong> means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies. There is also a discussion of limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the intended audiences, for practice and for future research.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disseminating and evaluating the research.</strong> Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h3>Topic 2: How to Ask a Good Research Question</h3>
<h4>Significant Questions</h4>
The most important part of the research process is beginning with a good research question.  This is something that will be highly relevant to completing of most of your assignments in this course, particularly the second assignment.  Your research question will be then guide you as you complete assignments 3, 4 and 5.

The research process often starts when you ask a question about something that you observe: How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where?  Questions can be based on what you observe in the real world, or on intuition or a “gut feeling”.

Let me tell you a little about my own research journey and then I will give you some practical tips to help you on your way.  In my undergraduate degree I studied two majors: psychology (the study of the mind) and kinesiology (the study of body movement).  In the final year of my undergrad I took the most fascinating course called the Psychology of Health and Well-being.  I was very interested in the topics that we studied in this course because it was the perfect pairing of my two chosen majors - the mind and the body.  One particular topic captured my attention and I was unable to let go of my interest in it.  The topic was female athletes and eating disorders.  This topic interested me for many reasons, but I was particularly interested in the impact that disordered eating (both physically and psychologically) had on the performance of females athletes.  At the end of my four year degree, I decided my education needed to continue into graduate work so that I could continue exploring my interest in this topic.

As I entered my Master's my focus was still on the topic of understanding eating disorders, but the population that I was interested in - female athletes with eating disorders - was a difficult and challenging group to study.  So I needed to make some adaptations to the research that I wanted to pursue in order to make my thesis project more manageable.  I will save you all the details of the 2-year journey of learning what works and what doesn't when you are studying a clinical population, but what I ended up with was a very different thesis project then what I had originally intended.

The topic I ended up studying was examining the differences between women with eating disorders, at-risk for eating disorders, and those not at-risk on a very specific psychological construct which is called self-presentation motivation.  Self-presentation motivation reflects the process that we go through in an attempt to monitor and control the impression we make on others (Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982).  For example, when we go for a job interview we usually wear nice clothes, get a hair cut, rehearse interview questions because we want to make a good impression on a potential employer.  Now self-presentation motivation in itself is not a single construct that can be empirically measured.  In my study this concept was measured using several different questionnaires and they were a) fear of negative evaluation (when a person is fearful of receiving disapproval and criticism from others; Leary, 1983), b) public self-consciousness (the awareness or sensitivity a person experiences from the opinions of others; Fenigstein, Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975), c) social physique anxiety (the anxiety experienced when your body is being evaluated by others; Hart, Rejeski, &amp; Leary, 1989), and d) self-presentational efficacy (the probability of conveying a desired impression on others; Leary &amp; Atherton, 1986).  If you are interested in reading more about this study you can find the published article here <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015306000122</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is what my research question started as: <em><strong>How do eating disorders impact the performance of female athletes?</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What my research question ended up as: <em><strong>What are the differences in self-presentation motivation across three groups which have known differences on measures of eating disordered behaviour?</strong></em></p>
Sometimes the research question we start out with is not the one we end up studying.  This was certainly true in my case.

The question that you select is the cornerstone of your work in this course. The assignments you will be working on will revolve around finding an answer to the question you are posing.  It is important to select a question that is going to be interesting to work on for the length of this course and a question that is specific enough to allow you to find the answer.

The Higher Education Academy and Sheffield Hallam University (2005) have developed an excellent guide for <a href="http://www.socscidiss.bham.ac.uk/research-question.html">Formulating the Research Question. </a>According to the authors, good questions are:
<blockquote><b><i>Relevant</i></b><b>:</b> The question will be of interest to people in your field and arise from issues raised in the literature or in practice. You should be able to establish a clear purpose for your research in relation to the chosen field. For example, are you filling a gap in knowledge, analyzing professional practice, monitoring a development in practice, comparing different approaches?

<b><i>Manageable</i></b><b>:</b> The question you ask must be within your ability to tackle. For example, are you able to <i>access</i> people, statistics, or documents from which to collect the data you need to address the question fully? Can this data be accessed within the limited <i>time</i> and <i>resources</i> you have available to you? Sometimes a research question appears feasible, but when you start your literature review, it proves otherwise.

<b><i>Substantial and (within reason) original: </i></b>The question should not simply copy questions asked in other papers. It shows your own imagination and your ability to construct and develop research issues. And it needs to give sufficient scope to develop into a research paper.

<b><i>Clear and simple: </i></b>Getting this clear and thought-through is one of the hardest parts of your work.  If you create a clear and simple research question, you may find that it becomes more complex as you think about the situation you are studying and undertake the literature review.

<b><i>Interesting: </i></b>This is key! The question needs to be one that interests you and is likely to remain intriguing for the duration of the project. There are two traps to be avoided. Make sure that you have a real, grounded interest in your research question, and that you can explore this in an academic paper. It is your interest that will motivate you to keep working and to produce a good research paper.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.2: Clarifying Your Research Interest (Assignment 2 - 10%)</h3>
The rest of the activities in this unit will help you access and assess scholarly literature in order to answer a specific question for your assignments.  Before we discuss how to access scholarly literature, you need to begin with a good research question.  This learning activity is about clarifying your research interest and asking a good research question.
<ul>
 	<li>Take some time to complete Assignment 2 and submit it via the assignment 2 drop box in the Learning Management System (LMS). Please refer to the Assignment 2, <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/clarifying-your-research-interest-2/">Clarifying Your Research Interest</a> link for further instructions about this assignment.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Topic 3: Accessing Scholarly Literature</h3>
Accessing scholarly literature can be a frustrating process. The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search (library books, online periodicals, internet search), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields that will potentially inform your research interests.

Part of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each. A very helpful discussion is provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pages 10-12.

There are three different categories of documents where you can find research reports: summaries and books, journal articles and early stage materials such as conference presentations. Many times you will see this sequence followed: A research project is completed, and the research is first published in a Mater's thesis or PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference. The research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and eventually it is incorporated into a book. By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years earlier. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-review process and be published. Therefore, the research referenced in the journal article could be at least five years old. It could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and publish something in a book. Obviously, what you lose in this process is cutting edge thought.

The chart below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature. You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) pages 10-12 for more details.

[table id=5 /]
<h5>*Note</h5>
High quality journals are determined by the peer review process, the journals impact factor (IF) and by professional reputation. The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited. The IF can be found on the home page of most online journals.

Peer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic/scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author's scholarly or scientific peers). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc.

Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a very useful tip regarding what sources of literature you should access. They suggest that although you are probably used to searching for books on a particular topic, it is important to "focus on reading recent research studies published as journal articles to learn the most up-to-date information in your profession" (p. 11). As a general rule, articles published within the past 10 years should give you a good idea of what is current in your profession.

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.3: Searching for Journal Articles</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapters 4 and 6 in the Badke (2017) text.  These two chapters discuss database searches and searching the library catalog.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the tutorial "<a href="https://vimeo.com/161998287/7661f12293">Preparing a research question for a database search</a>".</li>
 	<li>Next, click on the library link <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/articles">"How to search for articles.</a>" Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section on multi-disciplinary databases such as <a href="https://vimeo.com/160918763/913f61489b">"Academic Search Complete."</a> Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic in a multi-disciplinary database.</li>
 	<li>Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 2, use the Academic Search Complete database at the TWU library to locate a good example of a <strong>journal article</strong>. To do this you will need to:</li>
 	<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/library">library home page</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>In the first search window, click the databases tab and then click the articles and databases link which brings you to a different screen.</li>
 	<li>In the Database Guide screen you will need to select "A-B" from the A-Z list of databases at the bottom of this page.</li>
 	<li>The first database that appears on the next screen is "Academic Search Complete." Select this database.</li>
 	<li>You will be asked to sign in as a student with your pass ID and password to access the online database.</li>
 	<li>Once you have signed in, then you will be able to type your topic or question in the search window of "Academic Search Complete."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>In your reflective journal, briefly describe your experiences in the search for a journal article, what worked well, what did not, what key search terms did you use, what databases did you search?</li>
 	<li>Note that you will be asked some questions related to your search strategies as part of your blog post for this unit.  See <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/unit-2-assessment/">Unit 2 Assessment</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.4: Searching for Books</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Go to <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">TWU library homepage </a> and click "<a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/books">How to search for books</a>".</li>
 	<li>Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section "searching for e-books" such as "<a href="https://vimeo.com/164163119/b24ecb42e6">searching for e-books in the classic catalogue</a>." Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic found in an e-book.</li>
 	<li>Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 2, use the library catalog to locate a good example of an <strong>e-book.</strong></li>
 	<li>In your reflective journal, briefly describe your experiences in the search for an e-book, what worked well, what did not, what key search terms did you use, what databases did you search?</li>
 	<li>Note that you will be asked some questions related to your search strategies as part of your blog post for this unit.  See <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/unit-2-assessment/">Unit 2 Assessment</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Topic 4: Utilizing Scholarly Literature</h3>
After you have determined what sources you will be accessing, you need to conduct a search, and then keep track of your literature search strategy and results. The simplest way to do this is to use an online reference manager that will help you collect, organize, cite and share your references according to the referencing style you will be using.  There are several free, online reference managers available such as <a href="https://www.refworks.com/refworks2/help/Welcome.htm">Refworks</a>, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, and <a href="http://endnote.com/">EndNote</a>. TWU library has a research guide that describes <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/EndNote/">how to use EndNote</a>. This library guide will help you sign up for an EndNote account and also help you figure out how to use EndNote to download and store your citations in folders and then input citations into Word documents and create reference lists.

After you have retrieved the results from your database searches and organized them in folders in your reference manager, you need to select documents to review. Begin by reviewing the titles and abstracts. For those articles that you deem worthwhile, skim the article itself to determine if it is relevant to your topic. Read the introduction and literature review and examine the reference list.

As you collect relevant literature you can either enter it into a summary chart or just collect the abstracts. There is no single correct way to do this—but you will need to develop some sort of system that works for you. An example of a summary chart is provided below:

[table id=7 /]

The research process is not always linear. You may have a great research question or research topic in mind, but as you begin your initial database and library searches you may find yourself changing or refining your topic. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because the topic is so new and no one has done any research on the topic yet. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because you are not using the right search terms or keywords.

If you are having difficulty finding research articles and books on your topic then try to reexamine the keywords you are using for your search. Look up synonyms for your keywords and try to find the terms that are used in the research literature. Another helpful tip is to look at the reference list of any articles or books that seem closest to your topic. This can help you to see what sources other authors have used and can be a helpful strategy to track down articles and books on your topic.

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.5: Upgrading Your Research Skills</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Go to the <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">TWU library homepage</a>  and click "<a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/skills">How to develop research skills</a>." Begin by watching all of the video tutorials under the section "upgrading your research skills." There are several short videos in this section on Boolean searches, search history, and other search techniques.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective journal, briefly describe your experiences with upgrading your research skills.  What did you find worked well, what did not? What boolean searches did you use, what inclusion or exclusion criteria did you select?</li>
 	<li>Note that you will be asked some questions as part of your blog post for this unit.  See Unit 2 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Topic 5: Evaluating Scholarly Literature</h3>
After you have found several articles and books related to your research topic and skimmed them for relevance, the next step is to evaluate your information sources. Unfortunately, not all information that you will come across is going to be credible and reliable. Just because you find articles and books at the library does not mean that the information will be accurate or of high quality.

As an MA Leadership student, and as a professional, it is imperative that you are able to critically evaluate information you are reading in order to conduct quality research yourself, inform policies and improve your professional practice. To evaluate a source for quality and credibility you need to consider the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Authority:</strong> Who is the author? What are the author's credentials (educational background, past writing experience, expertise on the topic)? Is the author's name cited in other sources or reference lists? A simple google search will help you explore these questions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Currency:</strong> When was the source published? Is the source current or out of date for your topic? Remember the general rule is to use sources that have been published within the past 10 years.</li>
 	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the author’s intention? Is the information the author's opinion or is the author communicating evidence-based results? Who is the author's intended audience? Is it the academic community or consumers? Is the author's point of view objective and impartial? Is the language in the article or book free of emotion or bias?</li>
 	<li><strong>Content:</strong> What kind of information is provided in the article or book? Is it a research article, popular book or opinion piece on a blog? Is the information provided backed up with references or sources? What is the length of the reference list?</li>
 	<li><strong>Publication type/process:</strong> Who published the source? Was the source peer-reviewed? Is the publisher a university press or a large reputable publisher? Is it from a government agency? Is the source self-published?</li>
 	<li><strong>Bias and special interests:</strong> According to Panucci and Williams (2010) bias can occur during all phases of research from design, implementation, and analysis to publication. Therefore, careful attention to the interpretation of research results and study design will help identify bias. Driscoll and Brizee (2017) suggest that when it comes to publishing research reports, "most major publishers are out to make a profit and will either not cater to special interest groups or will clearly indicate when they are catering to special interest groups".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Activity 2.6: Take the Coconut Oil Challenge!</h3>
How do you know whether the information presented to you in a journal article, book, news report, etc. is true?  What is your process for evaluating the facts and assessing the credibility of the source?  In this activity, I want you to consider your process for evaluating sources and how that relates to your research, and also to your daily decision-making.
<ul>
 	<li>First, watch the following video. It's a 5 minute clip in which Dr.Oz presents his findings about the benefits of coconut oil:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/dr-oz-investigates-coconut-oil-healthy-or-not?video_id=5603049252001">http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/dr-oz-investigates-coconut-oil-healthy-or-not?video_id=5603049252001</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Next, read the following articles:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/coconut-oil-study-health-heart-disease-saturated-fats-1.4169540">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/coconut-oil-study-health-heart-disease-saturated-fats-1.4169540</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/136/3/e1">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/136/3/e1#sec-18</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://observer.com/2017/06/new-study-coconut-oil-ldl-cholesterol-levels/">http://observer.com/2017/06/new-study-coconut-oil-ldl-cholesterol-levels/</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://draxe.com/coconut-oil-healthy/">https://draxe.com/coconut-oil-healthy/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Finally, reflect on the following questions in your reflective journal:
<ul>
 	<li>Compare and contrast the findings of the video and articles. What 'facts' different, what facts are the same?</li>
 	<li>How do you know what sources you can trust, how do you evaluate sources of information, including news reports, youtube videos, blogs, articles, etc ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Note that these questions make up part of your Blog assignment for this unit.  See <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/unit-2-assessment/">Unit 2 Assessment</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activity 2.7: Read, Watch, and Search</h3>
In this learning activity, begin by reading chapter 7 in the Badke (2017) text which discusses searching information on the internet.
<ul>
 	<li>Go to the link <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/home">TWU library homepage</a> and click "<a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/library_research/skills">How to develop research skills</a>." Begin by watching the two videos in the section "using the web." There are two short videos on <a href="https://vimeo.com/160915822/0661b2b1c2">using google scholar</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/162602381/1b0d684fb6">assessing online resources</a> in this section.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, consider answering the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Briefly describe how you found your online sources and whether or not you think they will be helpful resources for your topic.</li>
 	<li>What sources of information will you use the most to conduct research on your topic?</li>
 	<li>How will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Note that these questions make up part of your Blog assignment for this unit.  See Unit 2 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>Additional sources for finding scholarly literature:</h4>
I also wanted to mention two other sources of information that you can use to gather information on your research topic.  The first is viewing the TED talk videos.  These videos are a great resource to help you become familiar with a researcher and their work on a specific topic.  You can search almost any topic on the TED website, the videos are usually under 20 minutes, and are very good.  You can find TED site here: <a href="https://www.ted.com/">https://www.ted.com</a>

The second resource is using the reference lists at the back of a book or of a journal article on your topic.  These are both great places to find additional sources of information on your topic and also help you become familiar with who is publishing information in your area of interest.

&nbsp;
<h3>Unit 2 Summary</h3>
In this unit you have learned about the research process and what is involved in asking good research questions.  You have learned how to identify different scholarly sources, how to access those sources through the TWU library, and how to keep track of your literature search strategies and results.  In addition, you have learned how to critically evaluate scholarly sources.  The activities in this unit are directly related to your third, fourth and final assignments in this course.  Coming up next week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, particularly through your scholarly writing.
