### Learning Activity 10.1 - Blog post

In unit 1 you were asked to blog about a recent decision you made as a leader. You were then asked to think through how you made that decision. For example, did you base the decision on previous experience, values, company policy, empirical evidence or expert opinion?

In this unit, the question is a little different. I want to know, if after taking this class, would you make your decisions differently? What new insights have you learned and how would those insights inform your decision making process now?

Please post your response to these questions on your blog (250-500 words).

Make sure you add a link to this page in your post.

### Learning Activity 10.2 - Blog post

This course has emphasized evidence-based leadership by equipping you to access, evaluate, and apply the latest empirically-based evidence and contribute to the scholarship base in the area of leadership studies.

My hope is that this course will convince you of the importance of basing your leadership decisions on the best evidence available in a given context. In light of what you have learned in this course, prepare a blog post explaining why you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader.
