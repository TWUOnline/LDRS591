<h2>Unit 8 Assessment</h2>
<h3>Unit 8 Blog</h3>
Part A and Part B blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.

In unit 8, you are asked to write the following blog post:
<h4>Part A (250 words)</h4>
Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change.  On your blog,  introduce  one practical problem that you would like to address for your action research project.  Introduce the topic, discuss why it is a problem and  discuss why this problem is the one you have chosen to address.
<h4>Part B</h4>
Next, using one of the practical problems you identified from Part A, create an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.
<ul>
 	<li>Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.</li>
 	<li>Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should be clear and well organized.</li>
 	<li>Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.</li>
 	<li>Upload your podcast to <a href="https://soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a>, <a href="https://tapewrite.com">tapewrite.com</a>, or another suitable online service and embed it in your post on your blog.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reminder: </strong>Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.
<h4>Be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 8</strong>. This helps to organize the class blogs and interactions.</h4>
<h4>Part C (250-300 words)</h4>
Finally, you will create a new blog post where you will peer review one Action Research project by a colleague in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships on Moodle under the assignments tab.

For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445.

Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:
<ul>
 	<li>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</li>
 	<li>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</li>
</ul>
Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects and please post your review <strong><em>on your own blog.  </em></strong>Make sure you include a link to your colleague's post so that they can see your review. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.
<h4>Be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 8</strong>. This helps to organize the class blogs and interactions.</h4>
<h3>Checking Your Learning</h3>
Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Can you identify a practical problem that can be addressed with action research?</li>
 	<li>Can you design an action research project that might be utilized in your leadership practice?</li>
 	<li>Can you evaluate an action research project proposal?</li>
</ol>
Feel free to review topics more in depth or continue on to the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/unit-9-overview/">next unit</a>.
