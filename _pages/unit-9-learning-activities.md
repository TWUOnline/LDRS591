### Learning Activity 9.1

This learning activity asks you to peer review one Action Research project (from Unit 8) by colleagues in the class. The instructor will inform you of the project that you will be peer reviewing.

For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:

* Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
* Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?
* Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
* Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?
* Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
* Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
* Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?

Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects in 250-350 words.

Please post your review ***on your own blog*** and include a link to their post so that they can see your review. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.
<h3>Learning Activity 9.2 - Blog post</h3>
* Read chapter 14, "Conclusions," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).
* Select **one** of the servant leadership articles listed under the unit 9 resources to focus on for the learning activity.
* Using the evaluation criteria on pg. 476-477 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the quality of the discussion/conclusion section in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 477 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale for the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Are the major results identified and summarized?</li>
 	<li>Are the results related to the literature?</li>
 	<li>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</li>
 	<li>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study's limitations?</li>
 	<li>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</li>
</ul>
Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response. Please post your evaluation on your blog (250-500 words).

Make sure you add a link to this page in your post.

### Learning Activity 9.3 - Blog post

We have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, prepare a brief 250- to 300-word response to the following:

The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is . . .

Close with one question that invites further comment and discussion.
