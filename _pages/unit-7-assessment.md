<h2>Unit 7 Assessment</h2>

<h3>Unit 7 Blog</h3>

Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 7, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):

<h4>Part A</h4>

First, create a new blog post and discuss the following questions:

<ul>
    <li>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate?</li>
    <li>Do you think mixed-methods research can provide a more complete picture for leadership studies?  Why or why not?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Part B</h4>

Next, discuss your evaluation of the mixed methods approach in the servant leadership article you chose.  Make sure that you include your quality rating (0-3) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

<h4>Part C</h4>

Finally, describe an example of a Transformational Servant Leader in your life and then discuss how you would apply a mixed-methods approach to the study of servant leadership.

Close with one question that invites further comments and discussion.
