### Learning Activity 1.1 - Blog Post

* Read Chapters 1 and 2 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text.
* According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), "research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or an issue" (p.4). 
  * Create a new post (250-500 words), and explain what your experience is with "research". 
  * Next, discuss at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader and explain how you made that decision. Make sure to include on what type of information you used to base your decision (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).
