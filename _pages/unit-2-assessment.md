<h3>Unit 2 Assessment</h3>
<h3>Assignment 2: Clarifying your Research Interest</h3>
The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient interests in your personal and professional life and practice.

In this assignment, you develop a concept map depicting your interests (personal and/or professional) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture (Trochim, 2001). The picture can then be used to articulate or refine research areas relevant to scientists and stakeholders.
<h5>Steps to complete this assignment</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Read Trochim's (2001) guidelines for concept mapping at <a href="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.htm">http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/conmap.php</a>.</li>
 	<li>Use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> (FREE!), <a href="https://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy.com</a> (paid), or another mapping program, to create a map similar to the sample pictured below, with you at the centre and your personal and professional interests around the outside.
<ul>
 	<li>The letters A through D represent areas of interest to the researcher (labelled “ME” in the sample below). For example, A might be "Health," B might be "Exercise," and so on, with as many different circles as you, the researcher ("ME") has an interest in exploring.</li>
 	<li>It is possible to add other circles to the concept map for more differentiation. Please feel free to include related interests as sub-items from other interests. You might have item C as "Teaching" and C1 as "K12" and C2 as "Higher Ed."</li>
 	<li>Using the areas of interest identified in the concept map, most researchers then "link" areas together in the form of research questions. For example, if circle A was "Exercise" and circle B was "Health," then possible research questions might include:
<ul>
 	<li>Does exercise participation improve or diminish health?</li>
 	<li>Does health limit exercise participation?</li>
</ul>
There is no limit to the number (and nature) of research questions the researcher creates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Use the mapping program to draw connections between areas of interest. Use a different style of connector, such as a dotted line, for these links.</li>
 	<li>Download your map as a .jpg or .png and upload it to your blog.</li>
 	<li>Create a new blog post with your concept map as the featured image and answer the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What research questions can be generated from combining different areas of personal and/or professional interests you have identified in the concept map? Please state three potential research questions that could be studied.</li>
 	<li>Identify the research question you feel is <strong>the strongest one</strong> to pursue for a future research paper, and outline reasons for your selection.</li>
 	<li>In what broad fields do you anticipate searching for literature that might inform your research question (e.g., education, business, psychology, healthcare, leadership, religion)?</li>
 	<li>Try using the following three statements to help get some clarity about what exactly you want to address in your question. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.</li>
 	<li><b>I am researching </b>______________________________________ (<b>topic</b>)</li>
 	<li><b>because I want to find out </b>______________________________(<b>issue/question</b>)</li>
 	<li><b>in order to </b>________________________________ (<b>application </b>- So What? - Project/Audience/Purpose driven)</li>
 	<li>The written portion of your assignment should be 350-500 words or less.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Assignment 2</strong>.

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Personal and/or professional interests are described. <strong>(4 points)</strong></li>
 	<li>Interests are clearly labelled on a diagram using electronic software. <strong>(6 points)</strong></li>
 	<li>Three potential research questions are identified that could be studied. <strong>(6 points)</strong></li>
 	<li>One research question is provided and reasons are clear why it is the strongest one to pursue for future research. <strong>(4 points)</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Overall Score = /20</strong>
<h4>Assignment Submission</h4>
Submit Assignment 2 via the Moodle dropbox.
<h3>Unit 2 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 2, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):
<h4>Part A</h4>
First, create a new blog post, and briefly describe your experiences with searching for scholarly literature.  What did you find worked well, what did not?
<h4>Part B</h4>
Next, choose either <strong>one</strong> journal article, or e-book, or internet source that you found on your research topic to discuss how you assessed the source based on the following categories.
<ul>
 	<li>Authority – Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials?</li>
 	<li>Currency – Is the source up to date?</li>
 	<li>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</li>
 	<li>Publication type/process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</li>
 	<li>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</li>
 	<li>Make sure you include the author(s), date, title, source (including the hyperlink).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part C</h4>
Finally, discuss what sources of information you will use the most to conduct research on your topic. How do you know what sources you can trust, how do you evaluate sources of information, including news reports, youtube videos, blogs, articles, etc ?  Close with one question that invites further comments or discussion.

If you are uncertain about how to set-up your blog, go to the following link<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> [Kelly to insert link]</strong></span>.

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 2</strong>. This helps to organized the class blogs and interactions.
<h3>Checking Your Learning</h3>
Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Can you identify a research interest and develop a good research question?</li>
 	<li>Can you employ different search strategies to locate different sources of scholarly literature?</li>
 	<li>Can you evaluate the credibility and reliability of sources of scholarly literature?</li>
</ol>
Feel free to review topics more in depth or continue on to the next unit.
