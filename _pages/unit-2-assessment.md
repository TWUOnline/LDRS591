<h3>Unit 2 Assessment</h3>
<h3>Assignment 2: Clarifying your Research Interest</h3>
The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient interests in your personal and professional life and practice.

In this assignment, you develop a concept map depicting your interests (personal and/or professional) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture (Trochim, 2001). The picture can then be used to articulate or refine research areas relevant to scientists and stakeholders.

<strong>Please visit <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/clarifying-your-research-interest-2/"><em>Clarifying Your Research Interest (Assignment 2)</em></a> for instructions on how to complete this assignment.</strong>
<h3>Unit 2 Blog</h3>
Blog posts are to be submitted by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Be sure to respond to 2 or 3 of your colleagues posts.

In unit 2, you are asked to write the following blog post (500 words total):
<h4>Part A</h4>
First, create a new blog post, and briefly describe your experiences with searching for scholarly literature.  What did you find worked well, what did not?
<h4>Part B</h4>
Next, choose either <strong>one</strong> journal article, or e-book, or internet source that you found on your research topic to discuss how you assessed the source based on the following categories.
<ul>
 	<li>Authority – Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials?</li>
 	<li>Currency – Is the source up to date?</li>
 	<li>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</li>
 	<li>Publication type/process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</li>
 	<li>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</li>
 	<li>Make sure you include the author(s), date, title, source (including the hyperlink).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part C</h4>
Finally, discuss what sources of information you will use the most to conduct research on your topic. How do you know what sources you can trust, how do you evaluate sources of information, including news reports, youtube videos, blogs, articles, etc ?  Close with one question that invites further comments or discussion.

Also, be sure to add the categories for this post: <strong>LDRS591</strong> and <strong>Unit 2</strong>. This helps to organize the class blogs and interactions.
<h3>Checking Your Learning</h3>
Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Can you identify a research interest and develop a good research question?</li>
 	<li>Can you employ different search strategies to locate different sources of scholarly literature?</li>
 	<li>Can you evaluate the credibility and reliability of sources of scholarly literature?</li>
</ol>
