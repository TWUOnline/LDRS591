<h3>Unit 8 Learning Activities</h3>
This week in Unit 8 you will get a chance to explore a new approach to research.  Action research "is a disciplined process of inquiry conducted <i>by</i> and <i>for</i> those taking the action" (Sagor, 2000, para. 1). Its purpose is to solve local/practical problems through the application of systematic investigation.  The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings.

Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals.  Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways that you will uncover in the readings this week.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Topic 1: What is Action Research?</h3>
Action research has been defined as “a form of applied research whose primary purpose is to increase the quality, impact, and justice” of professional practice (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 597). Its purpose is to solve local problems through the application of systematic investigation. The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings. Gay (1987) states “the primary goal of action research is the solution of a given problem, not contribution to science” (p. 8). Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals. Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways.

Formal research is typically conducted by researchers with a great deal of experience and/or training in research, and who wish to produce new, generalizable knowledge. Action research is typically conducted by those with much less experience in and knowledge of research, with the intention of solving a current, local problem. Formal research typically employs random or representative sampling techniques, while action research will typically employ convenience sampling. Formal research designs typically exhibit rigorous controls, with a long time frame, while action research designs display more casual procedures, often employing emergent designs, and are focused on short-term time frames (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg 2007, p. 598). Action research can serve personal, professional, and political purposes.

At its heart, action research is cyclical in nature. Gill and Johnson (2002) assert that action research is a planned intervention by a researcher, or more often a consultant, into some natural social setting, such as an organization. The effects of that intervention are then monitored and evaluated with the aim of discerning whether or not that action has produced the expected consequences. In other words, the researcher acts upon his or her beliefs or theories in order to change the organization (Gill &amp; Johnson, 2002, p. 71). Going back to Boyer’s model of scholarship, what distinguishes action research as research or scholarly inquiry (i.e., as more than problem-solving) is the explicit commitment to contribute to existing knowledge, even if it is not widely generalizable.

<h4>Learning Activity 8.1 - Read, Watch and Reflect</h4>
According to Mutimbi and Khaila (2011, p.27):
<blockquote>A standard research methods course at university emphasizes scientific ways of conducting research. Students are taught scientific methods of collecting data, analyzing it and reporting. They collect data and analyse it in ways that enable them to describe situations as they exist, and they come up with long ‘wish lists’ in the form of recommendations for others to implement. They become experts in analyzing and developing models to describe situations – <em>but they cannot change the situations</em>. In other words, they are taught to describe problems, but not to solve them. These methods are not suitable for workers who are grappling with real life issues and are looking for ways of helping solve their problems. They need research approaches and methods that enable them to generate data that they can use to solve problems.</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 13, "Action Research Designs," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video by John Spencer (2017) that explains what action research is <a href="http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/">http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/</a></li>
 	<li>Then think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. In your reflective learning journal list three problems that matter to you and that you think you can systematically address in your work situation. After reflecting on these problems, select one that you would like to address for your action research project.</li>
 	<li>Note that you will be asked to address this problem in your blog post for this unit.  See Unit 8 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topic 2: The Action Research Method</h3>
The method of action research presented by Gill and Johnson (2002) draws on Lewin’s theory of studying things through changing them (i.e., change as the method or process of research). Stringer and Genat (2004) outline a research process that has action as final step, after eliciting stakeholder perspectives, analyzing data (identifying key features of stakeholder experience), and writing the research report (i.e., change as the outcome of research). Stringer and Genat also emphasize the participatory process of action research in which change is brought about through the participants in the research project, rather than being imposed on them from the outside. They explain that a major purpose of participatory approaches to inquiry is to bring people together in a dialogic and productive relationship, enabling the development of a sense of community through the sharing of perspectives, the negotiation of meaning, and the development of collaboratively produced activities, programs, and projects (Stringer &amp; Genat, 2004, p. 9).

Glanz (1998) has suggested that an action research cycle consists of six steps, which may or may not be always addressed in order. The usual first step is to select a focus. This is typically followed by data collection, then the analysis and interpretation of the data. The analysis and interpretation of data typically would suggest action to be taken. Action is followed by a period of reflection on the results of the action, and on the basis of this reflection, the action is either continued or modified. The cycle then comes full circle to begin with a new focus (p. 27).

<h4>Learning Activity 8.2 - Podcast</h4>
In this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/#Digital_Literacy">here.</a>

If you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.
<h5 id="criteria-and-evaluation">Instructions:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Using one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.</li>
 	<li>Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.</li>
 	<li>Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.</li>
 	<li>Your project idea should be clear and well organized.</li>
 	<li>Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.</li>
 	<li>Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.</li>
 	<li>Upload your podcast to <a href="https://soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a>, <a href="https://tapewrite.com">tapewrite.com</a>, or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on your blog.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reminder: </strong>Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.
<ul>
 	<li>Note this podcast is part of your blog post for this unit.  See Unit 8 Assessment for more details.</li>

<h3>Topic 3: Evaluating An Action Research Study</h3>
According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015)
<blockquote>Action research has gained support across many disciplines including education, nursing, and clinical work. [However], some view it as an “informal” process of research, conducted by practitioners who are not formal academic researchers.  Action researchers typically report results of their studies in informal venues, such as conferences, websites, or local groups in the community. Hence, the design may not have the rigor and systematic approach found in other designs. However, it is precisely this flexibility and responsiveness that makes action research studies among the best source of information to learn about potential solutions to real problems because they are conducted in real professional settings by real practitioners. Therefore, when evaluating an action research study, you need to keep in mind the intent and standards for this particular form of research. (pp.443-444)</blockquote>
<h4>Learning Activity 8.3 - Evaluate and Post</h4>
Next, you will peer review one Action Research project by colleagues in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab.

For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:
<ul>
 	<li>Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?</li>
 	<li>Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?</li>
 	<li>Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?</li>
 	<li>Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?</li>
</ul>
Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects and please post your review <strong><em>on your own blog.  </em></strong>Make sure you include a link to your colleague's post so that they can see your review. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.

<h3>Unit 8 Summary</h3>
In this unit you have discovered how action research is related to, and yet distinct from, other forms of research that we have explored to date. You have developed your own action research project to find a solution to your own practical problems.  You have also developed a strong sense of what a good quality action research project is.
