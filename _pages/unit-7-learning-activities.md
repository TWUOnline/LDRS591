<h2>Unit 7 Learning Activities</h2>
<h3>Topic 1: Introduction to Mixed-Methods Research</h3>
This week, in Unit 7, I have prepared an audio message to introduce you to mixed methods research.  You can listen to my audio message here:

https://soundcloud.com/user-303479512/welcome-to-unit-7-2

<strong>Reminder: </strong>In week 8 you will need to <strong>create your own audio recording</strong> to share your action research idea with your colleagues.  Make sure you take some time to <strong>practice</strong> what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.  Have fun!
<h4>Learning Activity 7.1 - Read, Watch and Reflect</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Read chapter 12, "Mixed Methods Research Designs," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video by Dr. John W. Creswell, "<a href="http://johnwcreswell.com/videos/">What is mixed methods research?</a>" In this video Dr. Creswell explains how the use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods can provide a more complete picture.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate?</li>
 	<li>Do you think mixed-methods research can provide a more complete picture for leadership studies?  Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Note that these questions will help you complete your Blog assignment in this unit.  See Unit 7 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topic 2: Mixed-Methods Research Designs</h3>
A wide variety of mixed methods research designs have been used by researchers. It is common in mixed methods designs to see the researchers count (quantify) certain kinds of qualitative data.  As well, you will encounter quantitative researchers reporting how their research participants perceived or were emotionally impacted (i.e. qualitative data) by the experimental treatment (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2013, p. 97). As you look at mixed methods designs, notice how the following considerations help to differentiate the four variations of mixed methods that Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) distinguish:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the purpose of needing qualitative and quantitative data?</li>
 	<li>What is the sequence of qualitative and quantitative data collection?</li>
 	<li>What is the priority of the qualitative and quantitative data?</li>
 	<li>How do the two data sets inform each other?</li>
</ul>
For example in a <strong>c</strong><b>onvergent parallel design, </b>only one data collection phase is used, during which quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are conducted separately yet concurrently. This design is used to develop a more complete understanding of a topic or phenomenon.

In an <strong>e</strong><b>mbedded (concurrent nested) design, </b>only one data collection phase is used, during which a predominant method (quantitative or qualitative) nests or embeds the other less priority method (qualitative or quantitative, respectively). This design is used o gain broader and in-depth perspectives on a topic.

The <strong>s</strong><b>equential explanatory design </b>involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data. This design is used to help explain, interpret or contextualize quantitative findings.

The <strong>sequential exploratory design </strong>involves the collection and analysis of qualitative data followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. This designed is used to explore a phenomenon and to expand on qualitative findings.

<h4>Learning Activity 7.2 - Read, Evaluate and Reflect</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity, you will select <strong>one</strong> of the servant leadership articles listed under the unit 7 resources.</li>
 	<li>Read the article and then using the criteria on pg. 405 in Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), evaluate the use of the mixed methods approach in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 406 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale for your evaluation.</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, discuss the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What was the purpose of the study?</li>
 	<li>Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?</li>
 	<li>Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?</li>
 	<li>What were the results of the study?</li>
 	<li>Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study's purpose?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Note that these questions will will help you complete your Blog assignment in this unit.  See Unit 7 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topic 3: Using Mixed-Methods to Understand Leadership.</h3>
Mixed methods studies have the potential to provide strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research and provide a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone.  Molina-Azorín and Cameron (2015) have highlighted four ways that mixed methods research can benefit business research and this can be applied to leadership studies.  For example mixed methods can be beneficial for leadership studies because:
<ol>
 	<li>Collecting qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of the leadership context.</li>
 	<li>Attention to both process and outcome through the use of mixed methods can aid in building theory. For example qualitative findings can provide insight into what mechanisms contribute to a measured outcome.</li>
 	<li>Complex organizations with different leadership roles would benefit from analyses that are integrated across micro and macro levels.</li>
 	<li>The use of mixed methods can help bridge the academic-practitioner divide through enhancing the interpretation of results.  For example, mixed methods can helps to explain findings or describe how causal processes work.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Learning Activity 7.3 - Read and Reflect</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Read the article "Applying mixed methods to leadership research: A review of current practices" by Stentz, Plano-Clark and Matkin (2012).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Then in your reflective learning journal discuss the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Describe an example of a Transformational Servant Leader in your life.</li>
 	<li>What values and characteristics define that person?</li>
 	<li>How would you use a mixed methods approach to study servant leadership?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Note that these questions will will help you complete your Blog assignment in this unit.  See Unit 7 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unit 7 Summary</h3>
In general researchers conduct mixed methods studies when both quantitative and qualitative data together provide a better understanding of the research problem. The use of mixed method research provides a number of advantages, namely:
<ul>
 	<li>Provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research.</li>
 	<li>Provides a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone.</li>
 	<li>Provides an approach for developing better, more context specific instruments.</li>
 	<li>Helps to explain findings or how causal processes work.</li>
</ul>
