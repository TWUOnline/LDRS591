### Understanding Mixed Methods Research Reports

### Overview

Plano-Clark and Creswell assert that the decision to engage in qualitative or quantitative research is driven by whether the research problem calls for an explanation or an exploration (2015, p. 63). A third genre—mixed methods—has developed. Mixed methods is the conscious inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative methods and so doing, seeks to mitigate some of the inherent tensions and weaknesses in both. In unit 7 we will investigate mixed methods research design.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify and understand the used of mixed methods research.
2. Evaluate the quality and use of mixed methods research designs.
3. Analyze the qualitative and quantitative features of mixed methods research methods.
