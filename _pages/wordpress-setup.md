##### A Note About Privacy

Before you get started on creating your own blog you may have questions about how much you should share on your blog, and that is good. We are going to have you work through some activities to help you determine your level of comfort with sharing your growth on the web, but for now, there are some things that you can do to ensure that your data are protected on the web.

* Use the new privacy settings we have enabled by going to 'Settings &gt; Reading' and changing the visibility settings.
* Sign up for WordPress under a pseudonym. You do not have to use your real name on your blog. Just make sure that your instructor knows who you are and what your pseudonym is.
* Use the privacy controls in WordPress to protect your work. You can set passwords on individual pages and posts, or set them to be completely private. Just be aware that your instructor will need to be a user on your blog if you want to use private pages.

You should use the same WordPress site for this course as you did for the Orientation course or any other WordPress courses you have completed.

The category that you will need to use for this course is 'ldrs591'

##### Tell us the URL for your RSS feed

The final setup task for you is to tell us the URL for your RSS feed so that your posts will show up on the [course hub](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591). You posts will be syndicated from your site to the course hub through RSS, or Really Simple Syndication. The course hub will be subscribed to your 'LDRS591' category feed. Any time you post in that category, your post will show up in the feed on the course hub. The same will be true for all other participants in the course, so you only need to check one spot to be able to see what everyone is writing about.

When you click on the link to a post on the course hub, you will be taken to the site where the post was originally published.

To ensure your blog is connected to the course hub, please email your site URL to your instructor.

##### Blog

Once you have told us your RSS feed, create your first post and introduce yourself to others taking this course. Tell us a little bit about yourself, or tell us about your pets, or something else. Remember to be aware that your posts are public on the web, but that you can determine levels of privacy that make sense for you. Make sure that you add your post to the categories 'LDRS591' andÂ  'Hi'.
