<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the major results identified and summarized?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The results are identified in the Results section of the article. In the Discussion section of the article, the results are presented but they are not related to other models or descriptions of servant-leadership in the literature. Further the authors suggest: “that servant leadership can provide a successful alternative to other leadership styles…”(Melchar and Bosco, 2010, P.84). However, the question being researched was specifically about servant leadership and whether a corporate culture would develop that developed and attracted servant leaders. It was not research comparing how servant leadership style compares to other successful styles of leadership.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the results related to the literature?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the results are related to the literature, but they are very vague. Melchar and Bosco,  (2010), state that, “We were able to empirically test the servant-leader model in three high-performing organizations whose employees are expected to perform their duties at a very high level.” (Melchar and Bosco, 2010, P 85). They do not restate their research question, hypotheses,or themes. There is no clear logical presentation of the conclusion. The authors conclude that the Servant-Leader model is effective in a for-profit organization. But since there is no clearly accepted one model of Servant-leadership, it is not clear whether they are basing their findings on the characteristics referred to in the article and put forth by Russell and Stone, 2002, and by Spears, 1995 (Melchar and Bosco, 2010, P. 76), the Greenleaf model of servant leadership introduced in 1977 (Melchar and Bosco, 2010, P.75), or the description of servant leadership put forth by Rude, 2003, in Nwogu, 2004, P. 2. One has to read the whole article, rather than just the conclusion to clearly understand what model they are using in their research.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors state that their research proves that: “Clearly, servant leaders can be successful in a competitive, for-profit service organization (Melchar and Bosco, 2010, P.85)”. For-profit organizations then would be a specific audience for the research.  However, the sample size was fairly small, N=59, and the study was only conducted on 3 organizations all within the same industry. The authors admit that their results may not be generalized across all for-profit organizations. This contradicts their statement previously noted and it may have been better for the researchers to be more specific and state that: Clearly servant leaders can be successful in some competitive, for-profit service organizations. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the authors thoughtfully critique the study’s limitations, in that they admit that the sample size was small, only 3 organizations in the same industry were included in the research. In addition to the shortcomings of this research, part of the problem in studying servant leadership is that there is no one accepted model of what servant leadership is. This lack of a standard model, creates ambiguity in all of the research being conducted,as researchers are choosing different models or different criteria of servant leadership characteristics to base their research on.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors suggest that future research should be conducted across a broader spectrum of other for-profit organizations. They also suggest that there may be external or internal factors impacting the success of servant leadership in for-profit organizations and that there should be more empirical studies conducted. While it would no doubt be of value, studying the impact of external or internal factors impacting the success of servant leadership, as suggested by the authors, is outside of the scope of the current research that was conducted. If one is attempting to build upon the current research findings of this study, I would recommend the focus be on applying this research to a larger cross section of for-profit organizations in a variety of industries.</span></p>
