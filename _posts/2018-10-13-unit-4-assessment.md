<p><strong>Part A</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of research studies that are conducted; quantitative and qualitative.  According to Plano Clark and Creswell (2015), quantitative research &#8220;researchers analyze the data using mathematical procedures, including calculating statistics and plotting graphs&#8221; (p.66).  Whereas, in qualitative studies, the data consists &#8220;of words and pictures, not numbers&#8221; (Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 66).</p>

<p>Part D:</p>
<p>As a consumer of research reports, the most important aspects I need to consider in the introduction section of a high-quality research report are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the problem easily identifiable?</li>
<li>Is it a real world issue?</li>
<li>Is the topic clearly identified?</li>
<li>What does the researcher want to do with the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a great exercise for me, as I can immediately apply it to helping students write simple thesis statements and to helping my students with their own proper citing and paraphrasing (the more I&#8217;m learning, the more I can bring back and share).  I have found Plano Clark and Creswell (2015) to be an excellent reference source due to their detailed rubrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question for the group:</strong></p>
<p>Did anyone else find it extremely difficult to provide an actual grade of between 0 and 3? At times, I felt like I was the least qualified person to rate someone else&#8217;s scholarly paper when I know so little about writing them.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re not supposed give half marks, but I couldn&#8217;t help it! I felt at times like I was either being too generous or too harsh and found myself second guessing my original assessment. This was the complete opposite of how I am in my career. I am very confident in grading my own student&#8217;s work and helping them grade their work as well. It might sound weird, but it really becomes a reciprocal event where we learn from each other.</p>
