<blockquote>First, in light of our studies in LDRS 500, is critical thinking a necessary leadership skill?  Is the ability to think critically a leadership trait, or is it a learned behaviour, or can it be both?  How critical is too critical?  For example, if I am critically reviewing someone’s work, at what point does it just becoming an exercise in finding fault and no longer has any value? (Achsah&#8217;s Springs, 2018)</p></blockquote>

I loved your question! You have obviously been reflecting quite a bit on it.

I thought you might find the following interesting as it connects to your question. As part of the new BC Education Curriculum for K-12, there are 6 core competencies that all students are expected to reflect upon and to self-assess where they are at throughout their learning journey.

The 6 core competencies are:

<ol>
<li>Creative Thinking</li>
<li>Personal &amp; Social Awareness</li>
<li>Social Responsibility</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Personal &amp; Cultural Identity</li>
<li>Critical Thinking</li>
</ol>

As you noticed, one of the six is critical thinking.  Here is the student friendly language for which they reflect on where they are at.

I believe that critical thinking, like other skills is part of our life long learning journey. Some of us are also better at certain things than others. A lot of what is listed here, we do without even consciously realizing we are doing it in our jobs each day.

To answer your question of &#8220;how critical is too critical?&#8221;, I think the answer lies in what we have learned about Servant Leadership so far. The role of a leader is to help enable others to grow so that they can be their best selves. To do this, we need to focus on people&#8217;s strengths and to ask ourselves, &#8220;Is this helpful or hurtful?&#8221; before responding.  The role of the servant leader is to build people up, not tear them down.  Whenever I am providing feedback to a student, someone wise once told me that a quick way to know if something is acceptable, is to ask myself, &#8220;How would I be responding right now, if a TV camera was on me and this was going to be on the 6 o&#8217;clock news?&#8221;
