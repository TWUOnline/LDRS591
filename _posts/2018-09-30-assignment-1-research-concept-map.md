<p>This was truly a challenging assignment in many ways. The first challenge was deciding which interests to include on the concept map. In the end I landed on two personal interests, and three professional interests.</p>
<p>As I am traveling through Europe right now, my interest in world history is in the forefront of my mind. I have been a worship leader in my local church for many years, and worship music is another personal interest. I have worked in health care for over 30 years, and continues to be a passion. Specific to health care I am very interested in the sustainability of public health care in Canada, and improving patient and family centred care. I am a physical therapist, and clinically my greatest skill and passion is teaching patients and families how to self-rehabilitate, or self-manage their condition. I have been a manager for over 11 years, so leadership is a recent but dominant passion. I have 5 managers reporting to me, so I am very interested in how I empower and equip them. I volunteer in my local church with teenagers, have teenage and young adult daughters, and have many new graduates in my employ, so I am also very passionate about teaching the next generation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the technological issues currently being experienced in Europe my concept map is only a Word document at this time.</p>
<p>Based on the interests I selected, I was able to identify five potential research questions which are in the red text boxes on the concept map (please refer above). Four are related more to my current role as a director, and one is related to my clinical practice.</p>
<p>The one research question that I have selected as the strongest is: what teaching methods do managers perceive to be the most effective? The reason that I have selected this one is because I think it best meets the criteria that have been outlined. It is a topic that I will remain interested in and likely to pursue to completion. I currently have 5 managers reporting to me, one who has been managing for years, one who just began two months ago, and 3 who have various years of experience, so selecting participants is possible. This is also a question that can potentially be used as it is posed, or refined if too large in scope as currently stated, or if the question has already been answered as stated. I expect that since it crosses the lines of leadership and education in scope that a literature review will be possible.</p>
<p>I am interested in knowing how others selected their areas of interest. How would you decide?</p>
