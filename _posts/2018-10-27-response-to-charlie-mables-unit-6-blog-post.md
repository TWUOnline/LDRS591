A great question! I do believe that qualitative research does have a lot of parallels with marketing research. Both can involve observations, interviews, analysis of documents, historical analysis and  focus groups to name a few. However, qualitative research tends to focus on a smaller number of participants which might not lend a lot of credence to National marketing decisions for the amount of time and effort that would be involved. What works in one city/province might not work in another.  Quantitative studies that are randomly conducted with large numbers of participants might reveal more transferable data.  Qualitative studies might be handy for a company for specific ad campaigns that target a select group of people such as teens, seniors, pregnant moms etc.,.
