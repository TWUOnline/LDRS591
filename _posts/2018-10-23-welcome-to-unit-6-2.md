This week in Unit 6 you will be exploring a different approach to research: <em><strong>qualitative research methods</strong></em>. Plano-Clark and Creswell define qualitative research as &#8220;a set of procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting text and image data to answer research questions by exploring participants’ views&#8221; (2015, p. 286).

Qualitative research has three distinct purposes:  <em><strong>to describe, to explore, and to build theory</strong></em>.   Quantitative research and qualitative research designs differ significantly in what data are collected, how data are collected, how data are analyzed and how findings are reported.  As someone who was trained as a quantitative researcher, I would sometimes hear people discredit the qualitative approach to research. However, as qualitative research has become more mainstream over the last 20 years, now I would say the most widely held opinion is that there is no best method. “It all depends on what you are studying and what you want to find out” (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 43).  I now value understanding a problem or a phenomenon from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  For example, in order to understand the complexity and “messiness” of real-life organizations, it is important for leaders to not just rely only on statistics, but to also examine what employees. consumers, and leaders have to say from a qualitative perspective.

<h3><strong>Looking Ahead!</strong></h3>

Next week, at the end of unit 7, assignment #4 (Scholarly Article Critique) is due.  In unit 8, you will need to know how to do an audio recording for your action research idea.  Please make sure that you take some time over the next two weeks to review the instructions in the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/digital-literacy/recording-and-sharing-audio/">audio recording and sharing</a> lesson of the TWU online orientation course before you get to unit 8.

As always, let me know if you have any questions!

Have a great week.

Dr. Strong
