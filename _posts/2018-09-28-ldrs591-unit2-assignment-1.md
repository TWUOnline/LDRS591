<p>The social science domain represents an area of interest for me. I am sensitive to issues related to governance because my country of origin, Cameroon, scores low in the index of good governance (Kaufmann &amp; Kraay, 2018), and it is a desire of mine to contribute to the development of this country. Last summer, I discovered transformational and servant leadership. The model advocates by these theories responded to the style of leadership which I believe can transform the lives of people in Cameroon. I wondered, then, whether transformational and servant leadership model could influence the factors of good governance.</p>
<p>The map generated the following three questions:</p>
<div>First, could transformational and servant leadership core competencies enhance good governance?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Second, could Cameroon benefit from transformational and servant leadership to solve issues of</div>
<div>good governance?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem">Third, if adopted by leaders in Cameroon could transformational and servant leadership core competencies increase the nine factors of good governance?</span></div>
<div></div>
<p>Despite the similarities between the questions, I stood by the third for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am sensitive to and passionate about issues related to governance.</li>
<li>My country of origin, Cameroon, scores low in the index of good governance.</li>
<li>The model advocates by transformational and servant leadership responds to the style of leadership I believe can transform the lives of people in Cameroon.</li>
<li>The question offers more guarantees to provide a qualitative and quantitative study, and it Â includes an element of personal determination by the participants.</li>
<li>The literature on the issue is accessible.</li>
</ol>
<div>I would be looking for resources in the field of leadership, social science, economy, and psychology.</div>
