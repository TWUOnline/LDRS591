My name is Brenda Fernie and I am seeking to complete my MA in Business Leadership. I am currently working for my nation, the Kwantlen, located in Fort Langley, BC. My day to day responsibilities involves working for the economic development arm of the nation and my role is the Vice-President. I am most interested in developing my skills as a leader and in serving my community to the best of my abilities.

I live in South Surrey and have been in the area for my entire life. I&#8217;m married with two children whom are 7 and 11. The eldest is diagnosed with ASD/OCD and as such I oversee a home based program. In June of 2017 my family was gifted with an ASD dog named Hughey. He has quickly become an important part of my family.

My great, great, great Grandfather was Grand Chief Wattlekanium whom met Simon Fraser&#8217;s expedition in present day New Westminster. He moved the Kwantlen people for protection beside the Fort, which was operated by the Hudson&#8217;s Bay company. His daughter married a worker of the Fort whom was an American Indian &#8211; Chippewa. In addition to my Kwantlen lineage I am also of Musqueam descent. My great, great, great, Grandfather was a Musqueam Chief. His daughter, Mooskum Pooki, also married a worker of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay company with the last name Emptage. Emptage was a homesteader and cleared the land that the TWU Langley campus sits on today. These lands stayed in my families hands including up to the time of my late Grandmother. In the fall, the Fort Langley National Historic site hosts the ghost walking tours and the main subject is about my great, great grandfather, William Henry Emptage and his wife, Mooskum Poki (anglasized name &#8211; Louisa). It is said that the Fort Langley cemetery is haunted and that William is often seen wandering and looking for Louisa. I&#8217;m not sure I believe this as I&#8217;ve never seen a ghost myself but it makes for a fun story.

I&#8217;m looking forward to collaborating with the other students and in improving my research skills.
