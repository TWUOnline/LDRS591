<p>Having had the opportunity this week to delve further into Qualitative research and to read more of Plano Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), I decided to return to my first article, Principles of Servant-Leadership in Community Health Nursing by researcher Bonnie Sturm (2009)  in order to study it with a fresh perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Part D</strong></p>
<p>As a consumer of research reports, the most important aspects I will need to consider in the methods and findings sections of a high quality qualitative research report are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of research is being conducted (narrative, case study, ethnographic, grounded theory)</li>
<li>Whether the research focuses on a particular phenomenon of interest or a story of either an individual or a few individuals</li>
<li>Evidence of respect for and ethical treatment towards all participants</li>
<li>Understand and define the sampling of data (whether it is probability or purposeful)</li>
<li>Are there clearly defined themes/sub-themes and has the researcher coded them?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am still a work in progress in learning how to better read, understand and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative research studies. However, I definitely feel much more confident and familiar with qualitative reports than I do with quantitative.  Qualitative research studies are very applicable to education.  By conducting case studies and observations of small groups of students/teachers/administrators;  educators can gain a wealth of knowledge about classroom management, classroom set-up, student learning disabilities, relationships between staff and administrators, staff and students to name just a few. Important themes can be identified as well as the relationships between them and be explored further.</p>

<p>What I have learned the past couple of weeks isn&#8217;t necessarily about qualitative research. Life circumstances and the course content have caused me to be self reflective about my own practice. I believe that I will be a better leader in my Department as well as a better teacher after having completed these lessons/this course for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning is a lifetime process. We are never done.
<ul>
<li>This is something that I want my Grade 12&#8217;s to understand as they transition from high school.</li>
<li>This also applies to the members of my Department and myself as a teacher. There is always new curriculum to learn, and new and improved ways of doing things. It is detrimental to our own growth and those around us if we remain stagnant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning isn&#8217;t always easy and doesn&#8217;t always come naturally.
<ul>
<li>The past two weeks have been extra difficult.  The material is brand new to me and has taken me much longer to absorb than usual.  I began to get extremely discouraged and as the work piled up due to work (parent/teacher interview nights, overnight professional development conferences, facilitating school workshops, after school volleyball coaching) and family obligations, I began to feel like I would never catch up. It was an overwhelming feeling, especially when I found the content to be difficult to grasp.</li>
<li>This experience was a great reminder to me of why/how some students want to give up and why they stop coming to class. When students begin to feel, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point, I&#8217;m so far behind now&#8221; or &#8220;Why bother, I don&#8217;t even understand it&#8221; I can better relate now to that feeling and I don&#8217;t ever want my students to feel so overwhelmed that they want to give up.  I will be adjusting my teaching practice even further as a result.  I would rather have a student feel successful learning  smaller portions at a time, than feeling so burdened  down with work and burnt out that they give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus on strengths first.
<ul>
<li>Dr. Strong&#8217;s comments on our blogs are always very encouraging and she refers to each of our comments in her weekly summation blog post. It is a great reminder of how important it is to focus on strengths <em>first</em> instead of the things each of us need to improve upon.</li>
<li>This is encouraging and motivating and a great example of servant leadership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>I have two questions for you, one related to the topic this week and another simply out of curiosity.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your line of work, which is the design type that you would most likely use for qualitative research? Please refer to the extensive list on page 289 in Plano Clark &amp; Creswell (2015).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your biggest take away so far in this course? What have you learned about yourself as an individual and as a leader?</li>
</ul>
