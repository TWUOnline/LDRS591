I thoroughly enjoyed reading your blog post as well as looking at your concept map. A lot of your personal interests are similar to mine.  Your professional question that you would like to research is definitely a timely one. Each day it seems we are reading articles about the devastating affect the opioid addiction is having on families and our communities across the Nation. I look forward to learning more about your research through your posts.

To answer the question that you posted:

<blockquote>Do you think that research of a medical nature can be applied to the Canadian landscape even if it was carried out in another country?</p></blockquote>

I think that we can always learn from others research if we believe the research to be ethical, credible and if it meets the criteria of a reliable source.  I do worry sometimes about the research being conducted by pharmaceutical companies and question the bias of it. However, a lot of what we have today was discovered by others.

Some examples of research conducted in other countries that Canadians have ultimately benefitted from are:

<ul>
<li>Alexander Fleming, a Scottish researcher discovered penicillin</li>
<li> Louis Pasteur&#8217;s research conducted in France played a huge role in the discovery of vaccinations, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.</li>
<li>Marie Curie a polish researcher&#8217;s discovery of radium has gone a long way in the treatment of cancer.</li>
<li>Raymond Damadian, a researcher from the U.S. invented the MRI</li>
</ul>
