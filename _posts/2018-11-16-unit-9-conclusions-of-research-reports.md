Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) affirm “the conclusion section does not simply summarize the study – it provides a discussion about the implications, limitations, and significance of the study, often returning full circle to the initial research problem stated in the Introduction” (p. 465).&nbsp; Common elements in both quantitative and qualitative according to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) found in figure 14.1 are; a summary of major findings, comparisons or explanations with prior studies, implications and suggestions for practice, suggestions for future research and the overall significance of the study. The two differences between qualitative and quantitative conclusions, are that in qualitative research personal reflections are included and the summary of major findings is by themes. Quantitative research usually does not have personal reflections and the summary of major findings is organized by research questions or hypothesis (p. 472).

Part B

The study by Coetzer, Bussin and Geldenhuys (2017) is a very thorough and current research literature review of the functions of a servant leader.&nbsp; The authors intent in the discussion section was “to interpret the findings in a meaningful way” (Coetzer et al., 2017). The discussion section was very clearly organized into two main areas, strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership. They consolidate the findings discussing each relevant point with subheadings. The diagrams and tables sum up very clearly the authors thought and discussion points. The conclusion section doesn’t add any new information and has no references. They discuss implications for management, limitations and future research suggestions.

The implications section has practical suggestions of what can be applied from this study. They extrapolate possible development of future servant leaders by using the findings to “develop curriculum, use in hiring practices, performance management, and remuneration systems” and to “review and reward leaders” (Coetzer et al., 2017).

Applying the rating scale for evaluating the conclusion and back matter in a research report from Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) the overall score is 2.94/3 (p. 477). It is a high-quality paper right through with clear discussion, conclusion and back matter. Noteworthy was the fact that the main author did the systematic literature review on his own. I would think this would mean there was consistency yet the possibility of bias from one person. There are appendices available online, a detail Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) mentioned is the way research is heading to share supporting information (p. 475).

Part C

Of interest was the discussion of results, overall conclusion and the link back to the original question being researched. I was looking for what is accepted in terms of latitude in the discussion section. My work involves pharmaceutical products. Discussions in studies can not promise too much or go beyond the scope of what was looked at and must include back matter of possible conflicts of interest with the researchers. The pharmaceutical industry has very strict regulations of all interactions with health care professionals (HCP). We can only purchase a moderate meal for HCP’s if there is education involved that has learning objectives and a highly respected speaker. Some educational speakers do not take honorariums as they would have to declare it as a possible conflict of interest in their introduction while speaking or conducting research. Many working groups, for example those that put together the national guidelines for treatment of opioid use disorder, did not allow participation of some very experienced key opinion leaders because they had a meal paid for by pharma.

In your practice or the news, can you think of any examples of possible conflict of interest where research is involved?
