In unit 9 we have focused on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where all significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. A good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.  You also discovered that you will find three common elements in the back matter of a research report &#8211; additional notes, a reference list, and appendixes.  I&#8217;m going to highlight a few responses that I thought were insightful here under the following questions:

<strong>As a consumer of research reports what were the most important aspects you need to consider in the discussion/conclusion section of  of a high-quality research report?</strong>

&#8220;[A] summary of major findings from the research, recommended next steps, limitations of the research, how the research can be applied practically as well as references and other back matter&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/kwantlenbrenda/2018/11/15/week-9-blog/">Kwantlenbrenda, 2018</a>).

<strong>Are there any elements of this section that you still have questions about or finding confusing?</strong>

&#8220;The back matter and all its elements were not a criterion of high quality I used to consider. It is a new revelation&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/11/16/discussion-conclusion-section/">E.denguessi, 2018</a>).

&#8220;This is the section that I have typically jumped to when reviewing articles relevant to my practice&#8230;.However, based on the learning over the last number of weeks I realize now that I need to pay attention to the research in its entirety and think critically when reading&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/11/17/unit-9-conclusions-of-research-reports/">Achsah&#8217;s Springs, 2018</a>).

<strong>How can you apply this knowledge to your work context or current leadership experience?</strong>

&#8220;I can apply this knowledge to my work context because as part of my job, I need to collect, provide and interpret the results each year of student surveys for my Department’s yearly Action Plan summary&#8230; I have never included any formal back matter in my Action Plan summary before but will do so this year due to what I have discovered and learned in this course&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-9-discussion-conclusion-section/">A Walk in the Woods, 2018</a>).

&#8220;My work involves pharmaceutical products. Discussions in studies can not promise too much or go beyond the scope of what was looked at and must include back matter of possible conflicts of interest with the researchers&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/11/16/unit-9-conclusions-of-research-reports/">Charlie Mable, 2018</a>).

You have all provided insightful responses and questions this week.  Well done!

Dr. Strong
