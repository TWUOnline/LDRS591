<h3>Instructions for blog posts and responses:</h3>
As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to write about what you are learning on your own blog. You should have already set up a blog during the Orientation course, and used your blog in 500. You should consider your blog as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community.

Unlike other assignments in this course, your blog will not always be written in a formal academic style, but you should (like always) give appropriate credit to other people who have informed or inspired your thoughts. This can be done with a simple mention and link as a way to say thank you, <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2017/02/beautiful-benches-and-attribution/">like this</a>.

The point of your blog is to provide opportunity for you to do the work of learning in a non-threatening environment. It is expected that you will be wrong about some things, or at the very least, that there will be discrepancies between what you now believe and what you used to believe, or what your colleagues believe. This is good. We want you to change your mind, and that is difficult work.

As such, your blog won't be graded for 'accuracy' or 'being right', but instead for depth of thought and evidence that you are learning new ideas and incorporating them into your mental schema for later application. However, your blog will be a significant part of your final 'grade' (25%), so you shouldn't see it as optional.

Some of the blog posts do not require a discussion or a response, however, some of the blog posts do require you to close with one question that invites further comments and discussion from your colleagues.  Please do your best to complete the blog posts that require a response by<strong> Friday at midnight</strong> of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.  When you post, remember to tag each entry with the Unit and Learning Activity number so it can be easily searched.

All blog posts should be between 350-500 words.

<strong>Replying to Colleagues’ Posts</strong>
<p class="Paragraph">You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues blog posts when a discussion question is posted. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond substantively to at least two other classmates' blogs. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions.</p>
<em>Substantive responses may include:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;</li>
 	<li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;</li>
 	<li>Adding a new twist on a perspective;</li>
 	<li>Critically thinking about an idea/concept;</li>
 	<li>Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;</li>
 	<li>Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;</li>
 	<li>Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;</li>
 	<li>Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
What Substantive Participation is <strong>NOT:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”</li>
 	<li>Restating what has been said <em>(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so);</em></li>
 	<li>Disrespectfully disagreeing;</li>
 	<li>Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;</li>
 	<li>Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.</li>
</ul>
Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:
<ul>
 	<li>What would happen if…</li>
 	<li>Other times it may be helpful to…</li>
 	<li>It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?</li>
 	<li>You might approach this from…</li>
 	<li>Is it possible that…</li>
 	<li>Would you consider…</li>
 	<li>Maybe…</li>
 	<li>Possibly…</li>
 	<li>Sometimes…</li>
 	<li>I’m wondering if…</li>
 	<li>Do you think…</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="marking-criteria-for-posts-and-responses">Marking criteria for posts and responses:</h5>
The following criteria will be used to assign marks to your blog posts and colleague responses:
<ul>
 	<li>The original posting is of high quality, showing depth of knowledge on the topic. The post ends with an open-ended question to advance the discussion.</li>
 	<li>Replies to other students are <strong>posted to your own blog</strong> and provide a link to the original post on another student's blog. Replies are posted on more than one day during the posting period.</li>
 	<li>Response posts to peers' original postings are respectful, show clear synthesis and evaluation of the content read, and provide depth, breath, or new insight to the topic. Reply posts stimulate thinking and advance the conversation.</li>
 	<li>As appropriate, references are included from scholarly peer-reviewed non-course text or readings to support what is said in both original and reply posts.</li>
 	<li>All posts are clearly written and contain no spelling/grammatical errors</li>
</ul>
Marks accumulate at 2.5% per week 3= outstanding on all criteria above; 2= meeting expectations; 1= not meeting all expectations as outlined above but made an effort; 0 = did not make an effort to answer the question
