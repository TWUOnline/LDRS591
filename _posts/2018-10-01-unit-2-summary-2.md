<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Great work this week on the literature search learning activities and on the blog assignment reflecting on your experiences searching for and evaluating scholarly sources.  I know it can feel overwhelming at first to dive into database searches to find the information that you are looking for, but the work you have completed this week is laying the foundation for the skills that you will use continuously in this course.</p>
<p>I have reviewed everyone&#8217;s research questions and I am just preparing individualized feedback.  But I wanted to share the excellent questions and topics that have been generated so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Why is mentorship important in reducing ‘burnout’ in new teachers and necessary to help facilitate success so that new teachers can have a long and prosperous career? <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/clarifying-my-research-interest-with-a-concept-map/">(A Walk in the Woods)</a></strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ontario is moving to a model of Rapid Access Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinics, what are the success rates of this model? (Number of ER’s using this type of service, number of patients served, GP acceptance of continuing a patient in treatment.) <a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/09/28/concept-mapping/">(Charlie Mable)</a></strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>The model advocates by transformational and servant leadership responds to the style of leadership I believe can transform the lives of people in Cameroon <a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/09/28/ldrs591-unit2-assignment-1/">(Edenguessi)</a>.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>What teaching methods do managers perceive to be the most effective? <a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/09/30/assignment-1-research-concept-map/">(Achsah&#8217;s Springs)</a></strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Just so that you are aware, the assignments in this course are built around this research question.  Assignment 3 is a literature search (formalizing information you searched for during this unit). Assignment 4 is a scholarly article review.  In this assignment you will choose one article from your literature search to critically evaluate.  Finally, assignment 5 is a formal literature review answering the question that you have posed now in assignment 2. That is why is important at the beginning to make sure that you have a good research question that will be suitable for writing a literature review.</p>
<p>I will send out emails shortly to help you refine your research questions. So stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>Dr. Strong</p>
