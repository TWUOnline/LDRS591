When APA formatting is required for your assignments, here is a checklist of elements you should include:

<strong>General Formatting:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Use Times New Roman, 12-point font.</li>
 	<li>Double-space between all text lines.</li>
 	<li>Leave 1-inch margins at the top, bottom, right and left side of the page.</li>
 	<li>Indent the first line of every paragraph.</li>
 	<li>Use the flush-left alignment style.</li>
 	<li>Order sequence of my paper is: Title Page, Abstract*, Body of Paper, References, Tables*, Figures*, Appendices* (the ones with asterisks are not required for every assignment).</li>
</ol>
<strong>Title Page:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Running head: SHORT ALL CAPS TITLE  This is flush left, 1/2 inch from the top.</li>
 	<li>Page number 1 is flush right on the same line.</li>
 	<li>The title should exactly match the paper title but shortened if needed to accommodate no more than 50 spaces in length, including spaces.</li>
 	<li>Title information in included per my APA &amp; my instructor: first letter of any major words capitalized (4 words or greater), double spaced, centered in the upper half of the page.</li>
 	<li>Times New Roman 12 pt. font, no use of bold, italics, underlining, or abnormal font size.</li>
 	<li>My name is double spaced under the title.  It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font.</li>
 	<li>The institutional affiliation is double spaced under my name.  It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Abstract: (only required for final assignment)</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The abstract is on page 2.</li>
 	<li>Header is without the words, Running head.  The header text is in all caps and page number 2 is flush right margin. All are on the same line.  This continues throughout the remainder of the paper and should be set up using the word processor functionality of headers/footers.</li>
 	<li>The page title Abstract is centered, 1 inch from top of page.  It is not in bold, caps, and standard 12 pt. Times New Roman font.</li>
 	<li>The abstract is 150-250 words and is block style aligned to the left.</li>
</ol>
<strong>General Formatting for Subsequent Pages:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Each page header has the title in all caps, starting from the left margin, with the page number flush right, all on the same line.</li>
 	<li>The Header matches what was used on page 1 but the part, Running head, is omitted for the remainder of the pages.</li>
 	<li>The paper title is repeated in full on the first page of the body of the paper. The first letter of any major words are capitalized (4 words or greater).</li>
 	<li>The paper is organized with appropriate headings.</li>
 	<li>The introduction should not carry a heading label. The introduction section should start on a new page.  See 8.03 for more details.</li>
 	<li>Paragraphs in the body of the paper are indented 5-7 spaces or one tab stop.</li>
 	<li>Spacing between sentences is 2 spaces.</li>
 	<li>Lists can be enumerated or bulleted.</li>
 	<li>Within a single sentence for short lists use the  format, (a), (b), etc.</li>
 	<li>For a list of sentences or short paragraphs, use a list format: 1. 2. Bullets can be used if it better describes the list but not preferred, e.g. a lot of numbers are used in the list.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Writing Clearly and Concisely:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>I have used no more words than are necessary to convey meaning (APA, 2010, p.67).</li>
 	<li>I have used direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words (APA, 2010, p.68).</li>
 	<li>I have not used paragraphs that run longer than one double spaced manuscript page (APA, 2010, p.68).</li>
 	<li>Each pronoun refers clearly to its antecedent and agrees with the antecedent in number (singular or plural) and gender (APA, 2010, p. 79).  Personal pronouns are used sparingly.</li>
 	<li>I have only used "we" to refer only to myself and my coauthors (APA, 2010, p.69).</li>
 	<li>I have avoided using alliteration, rhyming, poetic expressions, and clichés. I have used metaphors sparingly (APA, 2010, p.70).</li>
 	<li>I used the active rather than the passive voice, and I have selected tense or mood carefully (APA, 2010, p.77).</li>
 	<li>I have used bias-free language (APA, 2010, p.70).</li>
 	<li>I have omitted the use of slang.</li>
 	<li>For any numbers written in the text, I have spelled out zero through nine and the rest are Arabic numerals.</li>
 	<li>I used the spell check on my word processor and read through the paper carefully to catch any typos, left out words, punctuation issues, etc.</li>
</ol>
<strong>In-text Citations:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Direct quotations include the author (or title if no author), the date, and specific part of the source (page #, paragraph # or section title).</li>
 	<li>All quotations &lt; 40 words are enclosed in quotation marks.  The in-text parentheses comes before the ending punctuation.</li>
 	<li>All quotations &gt; 40 words are shown as an indented block quote with no additional beginning paragraph indenting.  The in-text parentheses comes after the punctuation.</li>
 	<li>Paraphrasing is a restatement of the original source in my own words.</li>
 	<li>Paraphrased in text citations include the author (or title if no author) and the date. It is optional to include the specific page, paragraph, or section of a source that is paraphrased.</li>
 	<li>For any multi author sources, for any sources with &gt; 3 and &lt; 6 authors they are all written out the first time, but subsequent use, I can use the first author followed by et al.</li>
 	<li>If the information for the in text citation is included in the body of text I am writing and I have multiple authors, the word <strong>and</strong> is spelled out, Jones, Smith, and Black (2010)…..</li>
 	<li>If the information for the in text citation is all included in a parentheses an <strong>ampersand</strong> is used to separate the next to last and last authors, e.g. (Jones, Smith, &amp; Black, 2010).</li>
 	<li>For six or more authors, cite the surname of the first author and use, et al., the first time that source is used and any subsequent in text citations for that source.</li>
 	<li>When an author is repeated within a paragraph, with no other sources used in between, I can omit the date.  For a new paragraph, include all the elements of the in text citation per above.</li>
</ol>
<strong>References:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The page title, References, is centered, 1 inch from the top of the page and starts a new page.  Standard 12-point font should be used, without effects such as bold, italics or underlining.</li>
 	<li>All sources listed in the References have at least 1 corresponding in text citation.</li>
 	<li>References are listed in alphabetical order by the authors last name.</li>
 	<li>All lines are double spaced and for each entry the hanging indent is used.</li>
 	<li>Only initials are used for first and/or second names of authors.  There is a space between initials, e.g. Strong, H. A.</li>
 	<li>If there are multiple authors, they are listed in the order they appear on the original source.</li>
 	<li>Authors in the references are separated by commas (even for 2 authors) and an ampersand is used before the last one.</li>
 	<li>Year of publication follows the authors of the article in parentheses.</li>
 	<li>Titles of books, journals, technical reports are given in italics, as are journal titles.</li>
 	<li>Titles of books, journal articles, web sites are in lower case except for the first word, first word after a colon and any proper nouns.</li>
 	<li>The title of a web page that is an article contained in a larger web site is not italicized.</li>
 	<li>Journal article titles and book article titles are not italicized.</li>
 	<li>Volume numbers are given in italics.</li>
 	<li>Issue numbers are enclosed in parenthesis and not formatted with italics.</li>
 	<li>Paging is given as a range (e.g. 45-56) without using p. or pp. except for newspapers or magazines without a volume and issue number.</li>
 	<li>Publication information (books) includes the state 2 letter code with the city and country written out for all international cities.</li>
 	<li>For electronic articles, a DOI is used at the end, if available.</li>
 	<li>For electronic articles, if there is no DOI, then use the publisher’s home web site.</li>
 	<li>For any citations ending with a URL all hyperlinking (blue, underline) is removed and there is no period at the end of the hyperlink.</li>
 	<li>APA Style uses two kinds of capitalization to format reference titles: title case and sentence case. APA’s title case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are capitalized, and sentence case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are lowercase.</li>
 	<li>The titles of works that stand alone (such as a book or a report) are italicized in both the text and the reference list.</li>
 	<li>The titles of works that are part of a greater whole (such as an article, which is part of a journal, or a book chapter, which is part of a book) are enclosed in quotation marks and written in title case.</li>
