<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality quantitative research report are: to understand the purpose of the study and how the study will be conducted, and for a clear discussion of the results, including the interpretation of the data. Â As a person with limited knowledge of statstics, it is easier for me to understand the results when they are presented as a discussion in the conclusion section, rather than being presented in a Table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can one read the abstract and the data analysis and conclusion sections only, to have a basic understanding of the research?</span></p>
