<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have learned many new and more efficient ways to use the TWU library search page and I believe that this will help me to be more successful with my research. Although I found some of the topics for e-books very interesting, I believe that I will find the most current and valuable information through peer reviewed articles. In Clark and Creswell’s Understanding Research, they state, “when reading about research on a specific topic, journal articles are generally the best source.” (Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 11). The explain that journal articles are the best source because they are written by the people who actually conducted the research. This provides an unbiased viewpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To ensure that the articles are credible and reliable, I will invest time in not only reading th research article, but researching the background/credentials of the author(s). Also, I noticed with some of the articles that you can tell how many times it has been cited. I will look for this as well because if it has been cited by other authors of peer review journals, it is more reliable. I will also make sure that the majority of the articles that I reference have a publishing date that is current.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I have found a reliable article, I will also access the sources referenced within that article for further information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though most of my resources will be peer reviewed articles, I will still access some information found in e-books on the TWU website as I feel that the information is valuable and helpful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My topic that I have started with is as follows. It is formatted according to the 3 step statements that were provided to me by Dr. Strong.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I am researching </span><b>chemicals or dyes in processed and packaged foods and children with special needs </b><span style="font-weight: 400">(topic)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">because I want to find out </span><b>if chemicals/dyes in processed and packaged foods have an effect on the behaviour of children with special needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400">(issue/question)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">in order to </span><b>develop a nutrition program at our school that promotes the health and well-being of our students </b><span style="font-weight: 400">(application &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">audience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I learn more about being an effective researcher, I believe that this topic will change and evolve so that I can more effectively and efficiently find reliable sources. </span></p>
