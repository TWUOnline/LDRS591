Part A

<ul>
<li><strong>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate? </strong>                                                       Mixed method research aimed to bring the best of quantitative and qualitative style together According to Plano- Clark &amp; Creswell (2014) mixed method allows for the combination of the strengths of quantitative and qualitative style, to build upon one of them, and two questions to find answers.</li>
<li><strong>Do you think mixed-methods research can provide a more complete picture for leadership studies?  Why or why not? </strong>                                                                                                          The mixed method as the potential to build a greater credibility into servant leadership style. Referring to Molina-Azorín and Cameron (2015), Strong (2018) observed that mixed-methods research studies of servant leadership could lead to a development of a theory, a greater awareness of the context, an understanding of the macro and micro organizational dynamics, and bring greater understanding into the way results are interpreted.</li>

<strong>Part C</strong>

<strong>Example of a Transformational Servant Leader</strong>

My tenure as the head coach of the Capilano University Men Volleyball offered many Transformational Servant Leadership opportunities. The most significant, however, was my interaction with the team captains; We committed to meet weekly and discussed matters related to the life of the team, such as the creation of a vision, mission, values, guiding principles and goals; and they contributed to decisions that impacted the team significantly. The outcome translated into a better team environment and Increase of performance and a high level of commitment into the program.

Quantitative research could address the correlation between Servant leadership, Team environment, Team performance, and level of commitment in college volleyball teams. The Hypothesises could be that servant leadership will produce a positive team environment, will increase team performance, will increase athletes’ level of commitment to their team.

Knowing that other criteria could lead to the same result, I will want to know what are the specific elements of servant leadership that impact team and athletes. So, I could conduct qualitative research to find out these particular phenomena.

I can then run a mixed study to understand both the relationship and the experienced that lead to the relationship. I will design an Embedded QUAN(qual) experiment design, using survey and semi-structured interviews.

<strong>Question:</strong> I would like to know if it is common for researchers to assume that their audience understands the making of research method and designs. I am asking it because I found that the article I read supposed, at least from my perspective, that readers understand research papers.
