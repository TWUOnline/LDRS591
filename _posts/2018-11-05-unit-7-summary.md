Thank you for your responses this week regarding mixed-methods research. In general, researchers conduct mixed methods studies when both quantitative and qualitative data together provide a better understanding of the research problem.

Here is a summary of some of your thoughts on why you think mixed-methods research can provide a more complete picture for leadership studies.

&#8220;Organizations are complex and have often more than one goal or strategic mandate and therefore, this is where I believe mixed methods are beneficial to leadership studies&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/kwantlenbrenda/2018/11/03/unit-7/">KwantlenBrenda, 2018</a>).

&#8220;Leadership is a complex phenomenon&#8221;&#8230;. &#8220;I do think that people like numbers, and people like stories and that when you apply rigorous methods to both research methods this can lead to a greater understanding of a research problem&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/11/03/unit-7-understanding-mixed-methods-research-reports/">AchsahsSprings, 2018</a>).

&#8220;Mixed methods research provides more evidence (quantitative and qualitative), shares more insights (through stories/interviews) and highlights any needs for further explorations in the future.  This allows for a complete picture&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-7-mixed-methods-research/">A Walk in the Woods, 2018</a>).

&#8220;Mixed method allows for the combination of the strengths of quantitative and qualitative style, to build upon one of them, and two questions to find answers&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/11/02/mixed-methods-unit-7-post/">Edenguessi, 2018</a>).

&#8220;Looking at a problem or question from many different angles offers a rich, deeper result or answer to the research question. Mixed methods, which has exploded in the last 10 years, is a great way to provide a wide and deep view of a topic. Mixed methods lead to greater understanding, perhaps more solid conclusions, and practical solutions&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/11/02/mixed-methods-explore-explain/">CharlieMable, 2018</a>).

In summary, the use of mixed method research provides a number of advantages, namely:

<ul>
<li>Provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research.</li>
<li>Provides a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone.</li>
<li>Provides an approach for developing better, more context specific instruments.</li>
<li>Helps to explain findings or how causal processes work.</li>
</ul>

Well done!
