In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. Assignment 5 is focused on the professional interest you have identified and defined in Assignment 2 and extends the work you did in Assignments 3, and 4. Assignment 5 will be your critical analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully compliant with APA (6th edition) format.
<h3><strong>What is a Literature Review?</strong></h3>
A literature review is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area. It involves finding key relevant articles and books, and synthesizing concepts and findings for critical (i.e., careful and judicious) application to a given problem. In other words, a good review of literature is a synthesis of what current scholarly literature has to say regarding a given problem, presented in a coherent and compelling manner. An integral step in this course is to effectively critique and summarize scholarly literature.

An effective summary of an article or book will:
<ul>
 	<li>Mention the problem being addressed.</li>
 	<li>State the central purpose or focus of the study.</li>
 	<li>Briefly state information about the sample, population or participants.</li>
 	<li>Review key results/conclusions that relate to your problem or topic.</li>
</ul>
Once you have highlighted those key points, then you need to critically evaluate the article or book.

An effective critique of an article or a book will:
<ul>
 	<li>Evaluate each section of the article/book – Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion – highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each section.</li>
</ul>
When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing them. You need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study or book that you have reviewed.
<h5>Critical Thinking</h5>
One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing is the practice of critical thinking. Critical thinking is "that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing and reconstructing it" (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015). In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas (Heady, 2013).

Scholarly writing, should reflect higher levels of learning. According to Bloom's (1956) taxonomy there are six levels of learning: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. When you are writing a scholarly paper, the focus should not be on just identifying, comprehending material and applying it, your writing should also reflect analysis, synthesis and evaluation. What this means is that your writing (and your thinking) should be able to:
<ul>
 	<li>Break down ideas into parts and see how those parts relate and are organized to demonstrate analysis.</li>
 	<li>Re-arrange ideas into a new whole to demonstrate synthesis.</li>
 	<li>Make judgments based on internal evidence or external criteria to demonstrate evaluation.</li>
</ul>
When you are thinking critically about a scholarly article or book, you need to keep a few key questions in mind. According to the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (2017) the three key questions to ask are: 1) Are the results of the study valid? 2) What are the results? and 3) Are the results useful? These questions will help you break down ideas, re-arrange those ideas to synthesize them and help you make judgments about the information you are reading.
<h3>How Much Information Is Enough?</h3>
When performing a review of literature, it may be difficult to determine how much literature to review. To help in this decision, consider the main question of interest, or main subtopics, and include literature on these topics. Begin by reviewing the scholarly literature pertaining to each identified topic. Next, provide a summary of the literature that highlights the most important studies or articles, captures major themes in what you have reviewed and articulates how your research interest intersects with this literature (e.g., why we need to know more, or why the literature needs to be applied in a particular context). In essence, you want to include a summary statement of the state of knowledge in the area you are examining. Keep going until you sense that you have represented fairly the current field of literature. A good indication that you have done that is when you find authors mostly re-stating but not really advancing knowledge in the field. In other words, you have hit saturation.

Here is a really helpful website that further explains what a formal literature review is: <a href="http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview">http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview</a>

<em><strong>What type of literature review is required for this assignment? </strong></em>

The "type" or "style" of literature review that I am asking you to write for your fifth assignment is called a <em><strong>systematic literature review.</strong></em>  You can find an excellent example of this type of literature review paper here: Parris, D. L., &amp; Peachy, J. W. (2013). A systematic review of servant leadership theory in organizational contexts. Journal of Business Ethics, 113(3), 377-395.  This article is available through the TWU online library.

<em><strong>How should you organize and write a systematic literature review?</strong> </em>

I have provided a link to a really helpful document that describes how to write your systematic literature review. The title of the document is <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2214/2c9cb17b4baab118767e497c93806d741461.pdf"><em>What is a systematic literature review and how do I do one? by Dr. Andy Siddaway</em></a>

<strong>Please note: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I am NOT asking you to review ALL of the empirical evidence on your topic (this would be a huge undertaking).  I am asking you to select <strong>a minimum of 10 scholarly sources</strong> that you will use to review for your paper.  This means you are writing a mini-systematic review in <em><strong>a maximum of 20 pages (including title page, abstract, body of paper, reference list)</strong></em>.</li>
 	<li>I am also NOT asking you to do a meta-analysis (which involves statistics).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for the Systematic Literature Review</h3>
<h5><strong>Title page</strong></h5>
Create a title page in APA format.

<strong>Abstract</strong>

You will need to create an abstract that provides a key synopsis of the entire paper so that the reader can determine if he/she wishes to read the full paper. An abstract is a concise 250-word (or less), single-paragraph summary. In a minute or less a reader should be able to learn the purpose of the study, the overall research question or objective, a general description of the method or approach, important results, and important conclusions.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The introduction of your paper should begin with one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention. This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction.

In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs: What is the problem? Are there any relevant statistics that address your problem? Why is this problem important to address?

On the basis of your personal knowledge, as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a broad context for your topic by addressing what is known about your topic. It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Remember to include appropriate reference citations, and include any reference you cite in your paper in the reference list.

On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study.

To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you wish, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher.

Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the "problem" you are aiming to address?</li>
 	<li>What information will you need to provide a broad context for your topic?</li>
 	<li>Do you have any relevant statistics that you could use to support "the problem"?</li>
 	<li>Why is it important to address this problem?</li>
 	<li>What key terms should you define in your introduction so that the reader understands your topic?</li>
 	<li>What is the purpose of your paper? Or what research questions are being addressed?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Method</strong>

Following your introduction you want to tell your reader how you chose your articles to review. This is essentially re-writing the information that you collected for assignment 3. Here is an example template that you can use:

A review of the literature was conducted to identify scholarly research of XXXX on XXXX. Published articles were identified through searches of electronic databases that were available at the author’s university library. Databases included in this review were: [list specific databases that you searched]. The following key subject words were used to search the databases: XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX (include your search terms from assignment #3 here). Boolean “AND” was used to combine the XXX terms with the XXX terms. This search resulted in a total of XX articles.

The articles were then manually screened for relevance and attainability. Searches of bibliographies from relevant articles were also performed. Of the XX articles retrieved, XX articles were relevant to this review.

The articles were either kept or eliminated due to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included the following components: peer reviewed, published 2007-2017, written in English language, accessible through the university library. The exclusion criteria included the following factors: any study that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. XX studies met the inclusion criteria and were used in the review. The XX articles were drawn from a variety of scholarly sources. Table 1 depicts the list of journals included in this review, the number of articles from each journal and the database used to access the journal.
<h5><em>Critical analysis</em></h5>
In the critical analysis section of the paper you want to tell your reader what strategy you used for organizing, abstracting and critically evaluating important information from the articles you found. For example, this section could look something like this:

For each publication, the methodology that was used to critically appraise each article was 1) a XX-item rating scale for evaluating qualitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), and 2) a XX-item rating scale for evaluating quantitative studies developed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). The description for how articles were classified as high quality or low quality is presented in the table below.

[table id=13 /]

<em>Note.</em> Table adapted from Parris &amp; Peachey (2013, p. 382).

Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:
<ul>
 	<li>How did you choose your articles for your paper?</li>
 	<li>What inclusion/exclusion criteria did you use?</li>
 	<li>What databases did you search?</li>
 	<li>What key search terms did you use?</li>
 	<li>How many records were obtained in your search?</li>
 	<li>How many articles did you use for your review?</li>
 	<li>How did you critically evaluate your articles?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Results</strong>

In the results section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. This is similar to what you had to do for assignment 2. You may wish to denote these major themes with Level One Headings. If you are organizing your literature review along thematic lines, you may want to use Level Two Headings to further organize sub-themes that emerge within the broader themes. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through analysis and synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature.

The literature review "results" should include: the author and year of publication, the purpose of the study, type of study, method of data collection, major findings, and key conclusions. Then it is important to critically evaluate the articles you have reviewed. When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing items, you need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study that you have reviewed.

In this section you should describe the characteristics of studies included in detail in a Table.  In text, discuss your assessment of the scientific quality of included studies. Critically evaluate and integrate the results in an unbiased and systematic way, including stating whether the results are different and discuss possible reasons for this. Identify inconsistencies in study results and identify points of contention in theories, conceptualizations, and methods in the literature (Cooper, 2003).

As an example, below is an excerpt from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts" by Parris and Peachy (2013). In this excerpt, Parris and Peachy (2013) discuss the results from their review of servant leadership in one area, implementation of servant leadership. This is what they found:

"Three studies examined servant leadership in various organizational processes (Hamilton &amp; Bean, 2005—leadership development; Savage-Austin &amp; Honeycutt, 2011—organizational change; Dingman &amp; Stone, 2007— succession planning). Nevertheless, these studies were not supported by other empirical studies nor were their methodological quality sufficient to provide any conclusions" (p. 388).

Parris and Peachy (2013) provided information about the three studies they found under the theme implementation of servant leadership in the table below. This table describes the reference, type of study conducted, conclusions, the quality of methodology and the strength of evidence in support of the conclusion. This is an effective and efficient way of presenting information in a literature review.

The table below is adapted from Parris &amp; Peachy (2013, p. 385).

[table id=8 /]

<em>SL = servant leadership; QAT = quantitative study; QAL = qualitative study</em>

Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:
<ul>
 	<li>How will you organize the results section e.g., themes or categories, chronologically, theoretical or methodological issues?</li>
 	<li>Did you include at least 10 academic sources?</li>
 	<li>Have you summarized the articles you have reviewed?</li>
 	<li>Have you included the following information in your summaries: author and year of the study, purpose of the study, type of study conducted, data collection method, and key findings?</li>
 	<li>Have you presented the "results" from your critical analysis of your 10 academic sources? Did you present this information in a table or text?</li>
 	<li>Have you critically evaluated each of the articles you have reviewed?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Discussion</strong>

In the discussion section you should open by restating the problem you are investigating. You then want to state the major findings and discuss whether or not your literature review supported or did not support your research question. In this section you should describe your own interpretation of the results (e.g., identify gaps, inconsistencies, strengths, weaknesses based on your critical analysis) and link these interpretations back to the literature that was reviewed. You also need to discuss the limitations of your findings and make recommendations (and offer a rationale) for future research on the topic. End this section with a commentary on the importance of your findings and provide any implications that may result from the findings.

Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the problem you are addressing?</li>
 	<li>What are the major results you found?</li>
 	<li>How would you interpret your results (e.g., what are the gaps, inconsistencies, strengths and weaknesses based on your critical evaluation)?</li>
 	<li>What are the key limitation(s) of your results?</li>
 	<li>Can you offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic?</li>
 	<li>Why are your findings important?</li>
 	<li>What are the practical implications of your findings?</li>
 	<li>Provide a clear link between what you have learned from the literature and how it can be applied in practice.</li>
</ul>
<strong>References</strong>

At the very end list your references. Reference lists must start on a new page, and must be formatted according to APA (6th edition) guidelines pertaining to which type of literature is being cited (i.e., book by one author, book with an editor, journal article, blog and so forth).

<strong>APA formatting is required</strong> for this assignment.  You should focus on general formatting (including a title page and abstract), writing clearly and concisely, tables, in-text citations and references.  For more details visit the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/apa-style-checklist/">APA Style Checklist.</a>
