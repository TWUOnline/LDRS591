##### Peer Review

For some of your assignments, you will be asked to exchange your work with a partner in the class and perform a peer review of the content. Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like quality of arguments and evidence as well as the structure and grammar of the paper.

Your feedback to your partner should be 150-250 words and may be provided in point form.

##### **Peer Review Protocol**

Your instructor will assign partners for each peer reviewed assignment and post the partnerships in the assignments tab on Moodle.

You will exchange your papers with your partner via email. Once your partner has sent you their paper, download it to your own computer, read it, and make notes according to content, composition, and grammar as prescribed by the assignment. Make notes about the strengths of your partner's paper as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application).

Summarize your notes in an email to your partner in 150-250 words.

###### Please remember! {#please-remember}

* Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. Never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.
* Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.
* Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.
* Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!
* When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.”
* Use questions whenever possible. For example
* I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?
* Did you consider adding…?
* What evidence do you have for...?
* Remember the three important phrases:
* "I notice...".
* "I wonder...".
* "If this were my work, I would...".
