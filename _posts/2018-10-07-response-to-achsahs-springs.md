<p>My responses are included in italics below your questions:</p>
<p>How often are informal sources cited in scholarly writing? If not often, is information on citing and referencing these sources something that can just be “looked up” on the rare occasions when it happens?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I would say that it is not often that you would see informal sources such as newspaper articles, online videos, podcasts, or personal communications used in scholarly writing.  If you look at journal articles it is rare to find these sources used. It is more likely that you will use informal sources to prepare a blog post.  So some knowledge of how to cite informal sources is good.  But I always recommend that when writing a paper, that you stick to the more formal sources such as journals and books.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>How does a writer identify that they are too wordy, or too concise? (Follow up question: or is this the role of an editor?).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I always begin with a rough draft.  I create an outline for the structure of the paper that I am writing. Then I start with questions in each section that I need to answer.  I start answering each question as though they are isolated responses.  Then I start turning the answers into coherent paragraphs and then I begin connecting paragraphs for each question.  Here is an example of an outline that I would use for a scholarly literature review paper:</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A) Introduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the &#8220;problem&#8221; you are aiming to address?</li>
<li>What information will you need to provide a broad context for your topic?</li>
<li>Do you have any relevant statistics that you could use to support &#8220;the problem&#8221;?</li>
<li>Why is it important to address this problem?</li>
<li>What key terms should you define in your introduction so that the reader understands your topic?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of your paper? Or what research questions are being addressed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B) Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did you search for your sources? What databases did you use? How many sources did you find on your topic? How did you select the sources you chose to focus on? What were the inclusion and exclusion criteria? How many sources did you include?</li>
<li>How did you critically evaluate each of your sources?</li>
<li>Provide enough detail that another researcher could replicate your study if he or she wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C) Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How will you organize your results e.g., themes or categories, chronologically, theoretical or methodological issues?</li>
<li>How will you summarize the articles you have reviewed? Have you included the following information in your summaries: author and year of the study, purpose of the study, type of study conducted, data collection method, and key findings?</li>
<li>How will you present the &#8220;results&#8221; from your critical analysis? Will you present this information in a table or text?  If presented in a table, make sure that you include text that explains what is presented in the table.</li>
<li>Have you critically evaluated each of the articles you have reviewed based on the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Is there appropriate background information provided?</li>
<li>Is the research purpose clearly stated?</li>
<li>Was the study well planned? Was the method appropriate for addressing the research question?</li>
<li>Were the measures used validated?</li>
<li>Were the participants adequate and appropriately selected?</li>
<li>Was the data analysis rigorous and appropriate?</li>
<li>Were the findings clearly stated?</li>
<li>Have these studies led to new questions being asked, new ways of using existing knowledge?</li>
<li>Are possible explanations for any inconsistencies in the literature uncovered?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D) Discussion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem you are addressing?</li>
<li>What are the major results you found?</li>
<li>How would you interpret your results (e.g., what are the gaps, inconsistencies, strengths and weaknesses based on your critical evaluation)?</li>
<li>Do your results connect with previous research?</li>
<li>What are the key limitation(s) of your results?</li>
<li>Can you offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic?</li>
<li>Why are your findings important?</li>
<li>What are the practical implications of your findings?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-3-my-relationship-with-apa/"><em>A Walk in the Woods</em></a><em> mentioned in her post that she struggles with wordiness and redundancy in her writing. She suggested that she will incorporate Dr. Hatala’s (2016) method of crossing out unessential words or areas where she repeats points during the editing process.</em></li>
<li><em>Another suggestion would be to have a colleague (or a daughter in university) peer edit the paper for you. </em></li>
<li><em>Another method that I use is to read what I have written out loud.  If there is no natural pauses for me to stop and take a breath then my sentences are too long.  I will then go back and make my sentences shorter. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>I was instructed that the reference list for my last paper was also to be double spaced, but I note that references for the courses are not double spaced, nor were they in the quizzes – is this just because these references are not part of a formal submission?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, double spacing is required for APA formatting, even in the reference list.  See the APA Blog article <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2018/08/never-space-out-on-line-spacing-again.html">here </a>for more details.  For blog posts and learning activities pages on word press the reason why the references aren&#8217;t double spaced is because I can&#8217;t figure out how to double space or indent on this platform. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Is it appropriate and necessary to use references on blog posts?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is appropriate to cite the information that you use from the original source like you have done with in-text citations in your blog post.  However, creating a reference list for every blog post can be a bit arduous. I would recommend that you hyperlink the source of your in-text citation that you are using in your blog post, so that the reader of your blog can find the original source of your information.  You may have to check the requirements for this with each new instructor.  Here is an example:</li>
<li>&#8220;I will incorporate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRu1UPPubMY">Dr. Hatala’s (2016)</a> method of crossing out unessential words or areas where I repeat points during the editing process&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-3-my-relationship-with-apa/">(A Walk in the Woods, 2018)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should authors be using references on blog posts, or should this style of writing deliberately be more informal? Or does it depend on the audience?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it depends on your instructors preference.  I would always recommend that you provide in-text citations for any information that you are using that is not created by you.  This acknowledges the work that other people have done.  As I mentioned above, I think in blog posts you can just state the name and year of the source and then hyperlink to the original source of the information.  Here is an excellent (and short) article on <a href="http://cmnh.lstmed.ac.uk/how-to-write-an-academic-blog-in-5-simple-steps">how to write an academic blog post in 5 simple steps.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your questions!</p>
<p>Dr. Strong</p>
