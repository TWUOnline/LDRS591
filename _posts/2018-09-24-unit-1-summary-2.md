Thank you for providing your first posts over the past week!  It was great to get to know a little bit about each of you and to also learn about your experiences with research and decision making in leadership. Each of you provided excellent responses and very interesting and insightful questions for your colleagues.

Scholarly inquiry is “The process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions” (Penner, 2017).

So why are these skills essential for the leadership process?

First, research skills better enable us to make choices that are informed and are not made on a whim.   For example, Charlie Mable stated:

<blockquote>&#8220;Scholarly inquiry can help narrow down choices by being informed about what the best outcomes are after being studied. It takes some of the guesswork away.  I think I might know something by experience but having studies to prove one thing or another can reinforce my decisions or raise questions about why something should be changed or stay the same&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/09/21/introduction-to-scholarly-inquiry/">Charlie Mable</a>).</p></blockquote>

Second, research is the ‘best method’ for exposing commons myths that people have in different areas of life.   For example, Lara suggested:
<blockquote>&#8220;We live in an age where students (and most adults) just automatically turn to google to look for answers to what they want to know. Unfortunately, in the midst of this process, they sometimes take at face value the first thing that pops up believing it to be factual without questioning the source’s authenticity or the possible bias of data presented. I try to teach my students the importance of asking essential questions and of digging deep to get the answers that they seek&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/scholarly-inquiry-introduction-unit-1/">(A Walking in the Woods).</a>

</blockquote>

Third, research is important for leadership because research evidence can improve your practice.  Emmanuel has stated that:
<blockquote>&#8220;Evidence-based decision making is essential for leadership. It provides leaders with the opportunity to shape their organization based on information that is credible, trustworthy and tested&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/09/19/unit-one-blog/">E. Denguessi</a>).

</blockquote>

I think these three quotes have captured exactly what I hoped you had learned this week.

In summary, scholarly inquiry is one tool that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision making process. In this unit you have learned about what scholarly inquiry is and how our worldview can shape the questions that we ask.  You have also learned about the importance of scholarly inquiry for leadership, and the implications of evidence based decision making for leaders.
