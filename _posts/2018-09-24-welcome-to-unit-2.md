This week you will be exploring the topic &#8220;Accessing, Utilizing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature&#8221;.  This unit will practically help you with asking a good research question,  becoming familiar with different sources of scholarly literature, and help you get a sense of what makes scholarly sources credible and reliable.

In this unit you will begin by working on Assignment 2 which will help you develop a good research question, and the learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials and exercise on how to access, organize and evaluate scholarly literature.

Please upload Assignment 2 on the drop box on Moodle by the end of Sunday September 30th.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am here to help!
