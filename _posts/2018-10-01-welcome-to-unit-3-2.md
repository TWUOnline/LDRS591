This week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, particularly through your scholarly writing.  This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.

Your learning activities this week are very applied.  They will focus on the APA standards for the structure and format of your papers, writing clearly and concisely, and and citing sources.  You will also get to start applying these skills in assignment 3, and then continue to practice them in assignment 4 and 5.

Part of your blog assignment this week will be to submit questions about APA for me to respond to.  I look forward to reading your questions and working with you on APA style this week.

Please feel free to contact me this week if you have any questions at all.

Have a great week!

Dr. Strong
