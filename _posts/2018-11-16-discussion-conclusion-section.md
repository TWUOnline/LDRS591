<strong>Part A</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are the similarities and differences in the discussion/conclusion section of a qualitative and quantitative research report?.</strong></li>
</ul>

Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) argued that Qualitative study and quantitative study in their conclusion section differed about and shared the following: First the two methods include summaries. While qualitative organizes theirs by themes quantitative does the same with hypothesis and research questions. Second, qualitative studies used existing studies to compare the findings whereas qualitative studies draw on prediction and antecedent studies to provide an explanation to the results. Third, the two methods contain implications and suggestions for practice, limitation of their study according to their respective style. In addition, they called for suggestions for future research, and provide an overall significance of the study.

<strong>Part C</strong>

High quality research reports give a summary of the study by restating the purpose, and the mains findings, it provides explanation of the results, discussed the implications, and present the limitations. In addition, high quality research reports, invite further research to expand upon the findings. A quality reports must have a back-matter sections with the necessary information.

<ul>
<li><strong>Are there any elements of this section that you still have questions about or finding confusing?</strong></li>
</ul>

It is not a question but a realization. The back matter and all its elements were not a criterion of high quality I used to consider. It is a new revelation.

<ul>
<li><strong>How can you apply this knowledge to your work context or current leadership experience?</strong></li>
</ul>

A leader, in my opinion, is a teacher. Therefore, as advocate of evidences-based information, I could teach coworkers how to differentiate a high-quality research report to an average or a poor one.

<strong> Question </strong>

How could someone speak of researcher’s values such as Integrity, accountability, transparency, and global learning when reading a research report section?
