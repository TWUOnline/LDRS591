<strong>&#8220;Question from Lara &#8211; A parting question for you…</strong>

As a leader within your organization, do you find it difficult to challenge past practices that team members continue to use that are no longer justifiable? How do you initiate integrating evidence based changes? What research sources do you use most frequently to build your knowledge base?&#8221;

To answer this question I can say that yes sometimes I am challenged at times with past practices that team members continue to use that are no longer justified. I say sometimes because as I grow and learn about Indigenous traditional teachings I become less skeptical and open to practices that I may not have been aware of.

Prior to coming home from my community I came from a very structured environment with sound business practices. The business functioned like a well oiled machine however looking back, I can honestly say that the people working there were not happy. While on the surface it may have been successful I can&#8217;t help but think how much more successful it could have been if the employees felt engaged and happy.

In the case of indigenous community practices there is not much research available but instead anecdotal evidence that has been passed on orally from generation to generation. While I think it is important to integrate evidence based changes, I also think it is also important to acknowledge that just because the research isn&#8217;t available doesn&#8217;t mean that the practice is not right. In the end we all need to work together to be successful and so forcing employees to change without involving them in a discussion first, will only lead to unhappy employees. As leaders I think we need to be open as well that we may not always have the best answer available.

In leadership in my community we live by the seven traditional laws &#8220;Since time immemorial, we live by the seven traditional laws that guided our ancestors: health, happiness, generations, generosity, humbleness, forgiveness and understanding&#8221; (Kwantlen First Nation, time immemorial). <em>Understanding</em> in this case can go a long way to achieving employee engagement.
