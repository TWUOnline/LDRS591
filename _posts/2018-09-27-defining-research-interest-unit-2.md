<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Part A &#8211; My Experience Searching for Scholarly Literature</strong></span></p>
<div id="attachment_495" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-495" src="http://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/files/2018/09/search.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="133" /><p class="wp-caption-text">www.canstockphoto.ca</p></div>
<p>I experienced a plethora of emotions as I searched for scholarly literature that would allow me to delve deeper into some of the areas that I am passionate about pursuing. I started off very excited and pleased with a question I had formed on my concept map. I&#8217;d like to be able to say that I joyfully searched and was immediately rewarded for my efforts, however, this wasn&#8217;t the case at all. I began to feel woefully inadequate as I turned up empty handed over and over again.  I kept going back to the drawing board and my concept map and starting a different question from scratch. Sometimes there simply wasn&#8217;t enough information available on the areas that appealed to me the most. As the week wore on, I began to become really concerned that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to find a research problem.  I needed to find a question that not only appealed to me, and, presented a relevant issue that needed further investigation but also one that would provide sufficient information and data. With great relief (probably to my family as well), I finally settled on a topic! In the end, the databases that proved to be the most helpful in my search for the most recent scholarly articles were the ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center), EBSCO and Google Scholar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Part B &#8211; Assessment of a Source</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><em>Source:</em></strong></span>  <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ995200"  rel="noopener">Link To Journal Article: How Can Schools Support Beginning Teachers? A call for Timely Induction and Mentoring for Effective Teaching</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><em>Author:</em></strong> </span>Peter Hudson</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Author&#8217;s Credentials:</strong></em></span>  Peter Hudson is the author and contributor to 150 referred conference papers and journal articles.  He is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Education at Queensland University of Technology.  In addition to being an Associate Professor for 20 years, he has had 16 years educational experience as a teacher and as a Principal. His University research focus is on mentoring early-career teachers. He won a National Program Award from the Office of Learning and Teaching in 2013 and a National Citation Award in 2012 for his work on the <em>Mentoring for Effective Teaching (MET)</em> program. <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/hudsonpb/"  rel="noopener">(Link to Credential Information)</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><em>Currency:</em> </strong></span>The source was published on July 6, 2012 in the <em>Australian Journal of Teacher Education. </em>Being less than 10 years old, it is relevant and up to date. The author also included 47 references in his 14 page study.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> </em></span>The intentions of the author are to raise awareness about the growing need for new teachers to receive support with teaching practices, with pedagogical knowledge development and behaviour management. The intended audience for this article are school districts, school administrators, experienced educators and new teachers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><em><strong>Publication Type/Process:</strong></em> </span>This article was peer reviewed and published in 2012 by <em>Australian Journal of Teacher Education, 37 (7), pp.70-84. </em>The article ISSN number is 0313-5373.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><em>Bias/Special Interests:</em></strong> </span>The article is a qualitative study involving a small number of the author&#8217;s students who are part of the MET program which the  author was an active participant in developing. The author notes that the &#8220;study was limited with the number of participants and the geographic location, therefore it may be difficult to make generalizations beyond these immediate contexts&#8221; (Hudson, 2012, p.83). The author also admits that, &#8220;more research is needed on understanding how mentoring beginning teachers affects teaching practice and student achievement using a range of data sources&#8221; (Hudson, 2012, p.83).</p>

<p>As outlined by Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, pp 132-133), I will be selecting literature that is relevant and of good quality by looking at whether the source is an original source, if it&#8217;s been peer-reviewed and if it can be accessed through mostly reputable databases like ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center), EBSCO Google Scholar and TWU&#8217;s library. For literature on quantitative research studies I will refer to Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s (2015, p.211) chart outlining the criteria and indicators for evaluation and likewise to their chart on page 301 outlining the criteria for evaluating qualitative research reports.  In addition to books and peer reviewed articles,  when listening to TED Talks, watching news reports, youtube videos, or reading blogs, I will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>examining the credentials and experience of the speaker</li>
<li>looking for evidence of bias</li>
<li>questioning the intent and purpose</li>
<li>looking for how current the report is</li>
<li>looking for the number of references cited to review the accuracy of data reported</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Discussion Question:</strong></p>
<p>How does a study gain credibility if it is the first of its kind without  prior existing data to reference or build from?</p>
