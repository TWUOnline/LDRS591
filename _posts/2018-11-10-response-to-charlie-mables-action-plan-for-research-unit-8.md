I am greatly intrigued by Charlie Mable&#8217;s professional vocation and have been since day one! More education is definitely needed regarding opioid use disorder.  Last summer, it felt like I couldn&#8217;t go a single week without hearing about a new influx of opioid deaths, mostly due to Fentanyl laced products. As Charlie pointed out in her introduction, opioid addiction is a major problem in our Country. She stated that in the age group of twenty-five to  thirty-four year olds,  1 in 6 deaths are due to opioid addiction overdoses.

<strong>The Problem</strong>:  Determining what barriers may be preventing some family physicians from being willing to treat uncomplicated cases of addiction at their clinics through an ongoing maintenance program.

<strong>Purpose:</strong> Working for a pharmaceutical company that produces a drug called Suboxone that can help treat patients with opioid use disorders, Charlie&#8217;s purpose of her research is clear.  If she can determine what the barriers for family physicians are, perhaps through education, she can help reduce/remove some of them so that more patients can receive treatments. In doing so, her representatives can provide more treatment products to more family physician clinics to try and help stem the loss of life due to this addiction that is sweeping our Nation.

<strong>Data Collection &amp; Analysis:</strong>  Using a Mixed Methods approach,  and by contacting both a family health clinic that is participating already in providing treatments and one that is not, she genuinely would like to research and explore further why some family practice clinics are hesitant or not willing to treat patients with opioid use addictions.  She stressed the need for open ended questions so as not to bias the results due to how her questions are framed. I believe this is very important and essential due to the nature of her work. It would be discouraging and heart wrenching to have her research overlooked due to people thinking that her reasons were maybe financially motivated (being a representative for a pharmaceutical company), instead of genuinely trying to help those who are in need the most.  Through these open ended questions she would like to gather quantitative data through surveys filled out by both the doctors and nurses that work in the clinics. She would also like to collect further qualitative data by interviewing both a doctor and a nurse.  As part of her data analysis she states that she would code the data received into areas such as education, philosophical reasons, the number of patients etc.,

I humbly suggest, that perhaps, Charlie Mable might want to survey more than one non-participating and participating clinics in order to collect as much quantitative data as possible.  Only collecting survey data from one participating/non participating doctor or nurse might not be sufficient. Is it also possible to send out random surveys across a larger geographical area as well? This way the data that is gathered could be viewed as transferable to other parts of the country.  Qualitatively, she would still only need to interview  a small number of individuals.

<strong>Who the Data Will Benefit:</strong>  From the data gathered, Charlie will be able to share the information directly with her representatives and with her company&#8217;s medical and marketing departments.  She rightfully questions whether the question of her research is much bigger than just her company and whether or not the information gathered can be shared with medical schools and across the nation.

&nbsp;

Thanks for sharing Charlie! I look forward to learning more and wish you the best of luck in your research quest!  It was a pleasure to listen to your plan, as it is obvious how much you genuinely care and wish to help those who suffering.
