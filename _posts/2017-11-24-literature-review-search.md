The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve and review relevant literature. This assignment and Assignments 4 and 5 will be closely linked. This assignment will include the “paper trail” that provides the details of your search for relevant literature, and Assignment 5 will be the final document that summarizes the findings of your review of precedent literature.

In order to complete this assignment you will need to:
<ul>
 	<li>Identify your research question and key search terms</li>
 	<li>Use search strategies to locate and select literature</li>
 	<li>Write a preliminary investigation summary</li>
 	<li>Use APA formatting requirements</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 1: Identify your research topic.  </strong>In a short paragraph, state the problem you are addressing in at most a few sentences and then provide your research question(s).

<strong>Step 2: Record your search terms. </strong>In the second paragraph, identify the searchable keywords and domains of social science that arise from your problem statement.

<strong>Step 3: TWU Library One search.</strong> Next, you will conduct a search using your keywords in the Library One Search engine found at the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/library">TWU Library</a>.  This search will yield all sources of information related to your topic. From this search, <strong>identify 3 key academic books or e-books</strong> that you have found to be relevant to your research question. Record this information in a table in APA format.

<strong>Step 4:  Academic Databases search. </strong>Next, you will conduct a search of at least two academic databases using your keywords.  The list of academic databases can be found here at the <a href="http://libguides.twu.ca/articles">TWU Article Databases</a>.  You will need to <strong>identify 8-10 key academic journal articles</strong> that you have found to be relevant to your research question. Record this information in a table in APA format.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Step 5: Internet Search:</strong> Next, move into the literature available on the internet by conducting a search using a search engine such as <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/"><em>Google Scholar</em></a> or the<em> <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals.</a></em> You will need to<strong> identify 3-5 key credible sources</strong> that you have found to be relevant to your research question.  Record this information in a table in APA format.

<strong>Step 6: Summarize your procedure.</strong> Describe in a paragraph how you chose the particular articles and books you did (that is, what inclusion and exclusion criteria you utilized).  For example, the inclusion criteria may include the following components: peer reviewed, published 2007-2017, written in English language, accessible through the university library. The exclusion criteria included the following factors: any article/book that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. See the link below for an example of the "procedure" section.

<strong>Step 7: Create an APA format table.</strong> In a table you will present the information you have collected from steps 3, 4, and 5.  See this <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_tables_and_figures_1.html">link</a> for an example of an APA style table.  Also, please refer to pages 128-129 in the APA manual for more detailed information about how to present tables in APA format.  Here is what I am looking for:
<ul>
 	<li>Use tables for the purpose of simplifying text.</li>
 	<li>A table with 2 or fewer columns and rows should be presented in text format instead of a table.</li>
 	<li>In text, refer to every table. e.g. As shown in Table 2, the ….. OR (see Table 2). Tell the reader what to look for, but only mention the
major points of the table.</li>
 	<li>Number tables in the order they are first mentioned in text. Do not write “the table above” or “the table below.”</li>
 	<li>Be consistent in the formatting and vocabulary of all tables when writing a paper.</li>
 	<li>Single or double-space the entire table.</li>
 	<li>Italicize the table title. Do not italicize the table number.</li>
 	<li>Standard abbreviations and symbols, such as % or no. may be used in headings without further explanation.</li>
 	<li>Ensure each column has a heading.</li>
 	<li>Capitalize only the first letter of the first word of all headings. If a word is a proper noun, however, be sure to capitalize the first letter anyway.</li>
 	<li>Notes are placed below the table.</li>
</ul>
<b>Step 8: Preliminary investigation summary: </b>In a final section, in several <strong>appropriately cited</strong> paragraphs, provide the following information:
<ul>
 	<li>In several appropriately cited paragraphs, present a working knowledge summary of your topic (the basic facts required to make someone familiar with the topic) based on what you have discovered about the topic from reading the abstracts of your initial investigations of literature.  Here I am looking for you to incorporate a &lt;40 word quote, &gt;40 word quote, paraphrased information with correct citations.</li>
 	<li>Write a brief statement outlining your personal/professional interest in this topic. You will want to describe the relevant issues subsumed in your problem statement, including the urgency, the controversies, and anything else that will convince your reader that your problem is worthwhile pursuing.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 9: Create a reference list: </strong>List all references on a separate page in APA format.

<strong>Step 10: APA formatting is required</strong> for this assignment.  You should focus on general formatting, tables, in-text citations and references.

<strong>Step 11: Submit your assignment in the Assignment #3 drop box on Moodle.</strong>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<strong>Identify research question and key terms (5 points)</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The question, which you have written clearly and concisely in one sentence (or in question format), is well formulated to provide direction for your literature search.</li>
 	<li>You identified search terms and domains that arise from your statement or question above.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Use search strategies to locate and select literature (20 points)</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The search strategy and procedure was clearly described in detail.</li>

<strong>Preliminary investigation summary (5 points)</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Preliminary Investigation Summary: In several appropriately cited paragraphs, you have (a) presented a working knowledge summary of your topic (the basic facts required to make someone familiar with the topic to a limited extent) based on what you have discovered about the topic from your initial investigations of literature, and (b) a brief statement outlining your personal professional interest in this topic.</li>
</ol>
<strong>APA format compliance (10 points)</strong>

<strong>Overall Score: /40</strong>
