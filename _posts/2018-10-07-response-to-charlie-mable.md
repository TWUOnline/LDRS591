<p>I have provided responses to your questions below in italics:

What do you recommend to someone new to APA to ensure that all rules are followed before submitting a paper?

<ul>
<li><em>I mentioned this in <a href="https://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/2018/10/07/response-to-a-walk-in-the-woods/">a response to A Walk in the Woods. </a>I expect students to make many APA mistakes in this course.  I don’t expect everyone to read the APA manual and be able to apply every detail automatically.  What I do expect is that you try to begin applying what you have learned about APA.  You will find with every assignment that you will make APA mistakes, and that is ok.  I actually find the best way to learn APA is to make mistakes, correct them, and then learn what to do right the next time.  I still make mistakes and I have been working with APA style for 16 years. </em></li>
<li>I have also provided checklist for all of the APA elements that I will be looking for in your assignments in the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/unit-3-learning-activities/">Unit 3 Learning Activities </a> and I have provided additional checklists in each of the following assignments: 3, 4, and 5.</li>
</ul>

How do you reference online content?

<ul>
<li><em>Here is a great article by Lee (2010) from the APA style blog on this very topic:</em><a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/11/how-to-cite-something-you-found-on-a-website-in-apa-style.html">http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/11/how-to-cite-something-you-found-on-a-website-in-apa-style.html </a></li>
</ul>

Do you have to include the name of the speaker?

<ul>
<li><em>I am going to assume that you are referring here to a video that you have watched online.  If that is the case, then here is how you would cite a video you watched from youtube or Ted.com, or a podcast:</em></li>
<li><em>Follow this style if you viewed <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/10/how-to-create-a-reference-for-a-youtube-video.html">a youtube video</a>:</em></li>
</ul>

Speaker, A. A. (date). <em>Title of the video</em> [Video file]. Retrieved from http://youtube.com.rest_of_URL

<ul>
<li><em>Follow this style if you viewed a TED talk on the <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2016/02/how-to-cite-a-ted-talk-in-apa-style.html">TED website</a>:</em></li>
</ul>

Speaker, A. A. (date). <em>Title of talk</em> [Video file]. Retrieved from http://www.ted.com.rest_of_URL

<ul>
<li><em>Follow this style if you listened to <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/10/how-to-cite-a-podcast.html">a podcast</a>:</em></li>
</ul>

Speaker. A. A. (date). <em>Title of the podcast</em> [Audio podcast].  Retrieved from  http://source.itunes.apple.com

If there are multiple clips from the same presenter on the same topic, how are these differentiated?

<ul>
<li><em>One of the ways the author&#8217;s works could be differentiated is if there are different dates.  For example you may have the same author, but the author may have published the book in different years. For example:</em></li>
</ul>

Brown, B. (2012). <em>Daring greatly:  </em><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><em>How the courage to be vulnerable transforms the way we live, love, parent, and lead.</em> New York, NY: Penguin Random House.</span>

Brown, B. (2015). <em>Rising strong: </em><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><em>How the ability to reset transforms the way we live, love, parent, and lead. </em>New York, NY: Penguin Random House.</span>

Brown, B. (2017). <em>Braving the wilderness: </em><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><em>The quest for true belonging and the courage to stand alone</em>. New York, NY: Penguin Random House.</span>

Brown, B. (2018). <em>Dare to lead</em>. New York, NY: Penguin Random House.

<ul>
<li><em>Here is another great APA blog post on <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/10/reference-twins.html">this topic</a>.  This article only shows examples from journal articles, but the format would be the same for a video file.  For example a video file with the same speaker and the same date on similar topics would look like this:</em></li>
</ul>

Brown, B. (2015a). <em>Brene Brown on blame. </em>[Video file]. Retrieved from http://youtub.com/watch?v=RZWf2_2L2v8

Brown, B. (2015b). <em>Listening to shame.</em> [Video file]. Retrieved from http://youtub.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0

Brown, B. (2015c). <em>Brene Brown on empathy</em>. [Video file]. Retrieved from http://youtub.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw

<ul>
<li><em>In the examples above you are using the letters a, b, c to differentiate the different references.  If you were referring to the author in-text you would use the same system.  For example</em>, Brown (2015a) said&#8230;&#8230; and Brown (2015b) stated&#8230;&#8230;..and Brown (2015c) determined&#8230;&#8230;and so on.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for your questions!
