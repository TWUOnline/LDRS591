Well done on your blog posts this week!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading all of them and you generated some excellent questions.  I mentioned this on several responses this week but I just want to remind you that <em>I expect students to make many APA mistakes in this course.  I don’t expect everyone to read the APA manual and be able to apply every detail automatically.  What I do expect is that you try to begin applying what you have learned about APA.  You will find with every assignment that you will make APA mistakes, and that is ok.  I actually find the best way to learn APA is to make mistakes, correct them, and then learn what to do right the next time.  I still make mistakes and I have been working with APA style for 16 years. </em>

For the summary post this week I have provided a link to each of my responses to your questions.  That way you can read what each other asked and also read my responses.  Enjoy!
