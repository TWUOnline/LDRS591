Hi Everyone,

I really enjoyed listening to all of your action research projects this weekend!  I am glad to see that you all rose to the challenge to record yourself and post it on your blog.  I know there were a few technical issues, but I am glad to see that everyone posted their projects and were able to share feedback with their colleagues.

I am truly inspired by quality and diversity of  ideas that were shared in your presentations.  I think you all have raised excellent practical questions that will help solve practical problems in your professional contexts. Here is a summary of everyone&#8217;s project ideas:

<a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/11/09/unit-8-action-research-plan/">Achsah&#8217;s Spring</a>s has proposed a bi-weekly peer discussion group to enhance confidence and competence in having accountability conversations in her work place.

<a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/11/09/unit-8-action-research-project/">Charlie Mable</a> has proposed an action research project to identify the barriers family physicians face for treating Opioid Use Disorder so patients can get treatment with their family doctor.

<a href="https://create.twu.ca/kwantlenbrenda/2018/11/07/unit-8-podcast/">Kwantlen Brenda</a> has proposed an action research project to examine best practices in Indigenous procurement in B.C.

<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/11/08/esl-leaders-professional-ascension/">E.denguess</a>i has proposed a project examining the professional development opportunities available for ESL leaders.

<a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-8/">A Walk in the Woods</a> has proposed an action research project that is focused on identifying the benefits and ares in need of improvement of a teacher mentoring program in order to better support new teachers in her school district.

I hope you all enjoyed learning about, and thinking through, how to practically use research in your work contexts.

I have also read all of your peer-review evaluations and I am impressed at the evaluation skills that you have all developed over the past 8 weeks.  Well done!

Have a great week.

Dr. Strong
