<h5>Instructions:</h5>

An outline can be defined as an organizational plan to help you draft a paper. Writing an outline before beginning a paper is the most effective way to organize your thoughts. An outline begins with identifying your research question and then breaks down the parts of your paper in a clear, hierarchical manner to help you achieve the goal of addressing your research question. Your outline should include the five major sections listed below. Each section provides you with a few questions to help you think through the kind of information you will need to include in each section of your paper.

<strong>A) Introduction:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>What is the "problem" you are aiming to address?</li>
    <li>What information will you need to provide a broad context for your topic?</li>
    <li>Do you have any relevant statistics that you could use to support "the problem"?</li>
    <li>Why is it important to address this problem?</li>
    <li>What key terms should you define in your introduction so that the reader understands your topic?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose of your paper? Or what research questions are being addressed?</li>
</ul>

<strong>B) Methods:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>How did you choose your articles for your paper?</li>
    <li>What inclusion/exclusion criteria did you use?</li>
    <li>What databases did you search?</li>
    <li>What key search terms did you use?</li>
    <li>How many records were obtained in your search?</li>
    <li>How many articles did you use for your review?</li>
    <li>How will you critically evaluate your articles?</li>
</ul>

<strong>C) Results:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>How will you organize the main body of your paper (e.g., themes or categories, chronologically, theoretical or methodological issues)?</li>
    <li>Did you include 10-15 academic sources?</li>
    <li>How will you summarize the articles you have reviewed?</li>
    <li>Have you included the following information in your summaries: author and year of the study, purpose of the study, type of study conducted, data collection method, and key findings?</li>
    <li>How you will present the "results" from your critical analysis of your 10 to 15 academic sources? Will you present this information in a table or text?</li>
</ul>

Have you critically evaluated each of the articles you have reviewed based on the following questions?

<ul>
    <li>Is there appropriate background information provided?</li>
    <li>Is the research purpose clearly stated?</li>
    <li>Was the study well planned? Was the method appropriate for addressing the research question?</li>
    <li>Were the measures used validated?</li>
    <li>Were the participants adequate and appropriately selected?</li>
    <li>Was the data analysis rigorous and appropriate?</li>
    <li>Were the findings clearly stated?</li>
    <li>Have these studies led to new questions being asked, new ways of using existing knowledge?</li>
    <li>Are possible explanations for any inconsistencies in the literature uncovered?</li>
</ul>

<strong>D) Discussion:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>What is the problem you are addressing?</li>
    <li>What are the major results you found?</li>
    <li>How would you interpret your results (e.g., what are the gaps, inconsistencies, strengths and weaknesses based on your critical evaluation)?</li>
    <li>Do your results connect with previous research?</li>
    <li>What are the key limitation(s) of your results?</li>
    <li>Can you offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic?</li>
    <li>Why are your findings important?</li>
    <li>What are the practical implications of your findings?</li>
</ul>
