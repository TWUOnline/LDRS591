I think it is important to be honest, especially about what we <strong><em>don&#8217;t</em></strong> know. We need to be open and willing to see things from another persons lens and to ask a lot of questions.   When looking at historical narratives in the classroom there are always differing perspectives depending upon who is recording the documentation. Is it a first hand account? Is it from a reliable source? When studying European Medieval History, it was  helpful to note what was written from the viewpoint of each group involved.

There are also those among us, who are rich in knowledge about certain areas. Not only is it okay to ask questions, it is also strongly encouraged. For example,  I feel very blessed and grateful for the guidance myself and my students have received from our Aboriginal Support worker in helping us to better understand the atrocities of our own history through activities such as holding a Blanket Ceremony representing the loss of land and looking at first hand accounts of  residential school survivors.  Students and teachers are walking away better informed and knowledgable in ways that they never were before.

I believe that when we open our minds, question the evidence presented and can look at multiple reliable and credible viewpoints is when we  are able to learn the most.
