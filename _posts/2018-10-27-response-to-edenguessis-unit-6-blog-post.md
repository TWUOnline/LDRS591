<blockquote>How does one identify biases in qualitative studies considering the level of subjectivity involved in the interpretation of data? (Edenguessi, 2018)</p></blockquote>

I really liked your question! I guess one has to look at the credentials of the researcher, the participants in the study (how were they chosen and how many), the type of study conducted, whether the data was coded and how it relates to the question being explored.

Is the researcher going to gain profitability from this data? If so, in what way?  Has this research been peer reviewed? Published? In what kind of journal? How credible is the journal in which it is published compared to others?
