<p><strong>Welcome to LDRS 591; Scholarly Inquiry Fall 2018!</strong></p>
<p>I am glad to see that everyone has created their own Word Press site and that you are connected to the main course site.  If you could please send me a quick email to introduce yourself and let me know what your word press site url is, that would be very helpful. You can reach me at Heather.Strong@twu.ca</p>
<p>This course is organized into 10 units running from September 17-November 25, 2018. Each unit will provide you with the following information:</p>

<li>Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each week.</li>

<p class="WPNormal">In this course you can expect that I will maintain a positive learning environment for all students.  It is important that you know that I will treat all students fairly and with respect and I will encourage discussion and participation and will offer adequate time for students to answer all questions and assignments.</p>
<p>Please note that I will do my best to respond to emails within 48 hrs. I will return graded work in a timely fashion (usually within one week of submission) and will let you know if I need more time.</p>
