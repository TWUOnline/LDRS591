<p><strong>Part A</strong></p>
<p><em>Quantitative and Qualitative Research Debate:</em></p>
<p>There shouldn&#8217;t be any debates over quantitative or qualitative research reports. Each research type plays a key role depending on what it is you are seeking. There is a rightful time and place for each of them. Qualitative data can provide stories that enable people to make personal connections to the information being shared and allow people to explore questions further.  Quantitative data provides numerical information that can help answer questions.   We have the opportunity to learn from both, and isn&#8217;t that the point?</p>
<p><em>Mixed Methods Research and Leadership Studies:</em></p>
<p>What makes a mixed methods research report stand out when it comes to leadership studies is that not only can it provide a numerical explanation for certain phenomenon,  it can also address more than one question at a time and it enables the stories behind the data to be shared.  Mixed methods research provides more evidence (quantitative and qualitative),  shares more insights (through stories/interviews) and highlights any needs for further explorations in the future.  This allows for a complete picture.</p>

<p>Criteria for evaluating the use of mixed methods in a research report</p>

<p>Part C</p>
<p>An  exemplary example of a Transformational Servant Leader in my life is my 86 year old (soon to be 87) Mom! I am so grateful to have her as my mentor and my confidante. The ways in which my Mom demonstrates these qualities is:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is sensitive to the emotional well being of others (always willing to listen, she will spend hours connecting with family, friends and members of her church  and our local community).</li>
<li>She always puts others needs first before her own (she has always sacrificed so much to help others, especially her kids and grandchildren).</li>
<li>She helps others grow and succeed (she is my biggest supporter, always encouraging me to pursue my  personal and professional dreams and to complete my Masters).</li>
<li>She behaves ethically (her integrity and honesty is exemplary and she is a true role model).</li>
<li>She empowers others to have confidence in their own abilities (she has always encouraged her children to be independent and self sufficient. She didn&#8217;t shy away from giving the freedom to let us fly on our own).</li>
<li> She creates value for the community by giving back to her church group and connecting with local community members to help make our neighbourhood a more warm and welcoming place to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would apply a mixed methods approach to the study of servant leadership by conducting a convergent parallel design study that would enable the reader to &#8220;develop a complete and valid understanding&#8221; (Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 391) of the research conducted <em>or</em> by using a multiphase study that was &#8220;aimed at achieving an overall objective such as developing and evaluating a program&#8221; (Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 391).  Both of these mixed methods research designs would help assist in providing a clearer picture of transformational servant leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Did anyone else find this particular research report (Black, 2010) to not quite meet the same set of rigorous standards as others that we have been looking at in the past few weeks?  I was quite excited to read it and then was left feeling deflated and disappointed by the lack of rigour.</p>
