<p>This week in Unit 5 you had to describe the differences between a quantitative and qualitative research report, evaluate the research design, participants, data collection, analysis and results of a quantitative research report and discuss the importance of understanding the methods and results section of a quantitative research report.</p>
<p>The learning activities this week were tough, especially if you have never taken a course in statistics.  I know a few of you mentioned that in order to truly understand the results of a quantitative study you would need an entire course on the topic and this is partly true.  I wanted to encourage all of you and let you know that I saw evidence of great effort to understand the research design and results reported in the quantitative studies.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights regarding the use of quantitative research reports in current leadership contexts:</p>
<p>&#8220;In my current role as a leader, having the time to create a research report is not likely however having the ability to read research reports on industry trends is essential. In particular in reading research reports on leadership styles and trends that effect employee morale and productivity&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/kwantlenbrenda/2018/10/16/unit-5-assessment/">Kwantlenbrenda, 2018</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding all of the elements of statistics and measurement are not clear to me at this point.  It is not something to fear, just to be aware of. In my work context, it will make me a more informed and better consumer of research papers and knowing how much emphasis to place on conclusions of the study&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/10/19/unit-5-quantitative-research/">Charlie Mable, 2018</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;The symbols, although explained in Plano–Clark &amp; Creswell (2015), deserves an entire statistic course in order to be fully understood. The good news is that all the formula could be computerized, and their values reported in an excel sheet. I intend to use the information learned to better assess articles in the future. Furthermore, the chapter provided me with new vocabularies professionally and personally relevance&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/10/19/unit-5-post/">E.denguessi, 2018</a>)</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like trying to learn a whole different language to be honest! [However,] I can apply this knowledge to my current leadership experience if I ever wish to examine in more detail statistical data collected on specific educational questions that require an explanation&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-5/">A Walk in the Woods, 2018</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think that being a knowledgeable consumer of the research literature is critical in health care and will be the way of the future.  Patients and professionals alike expect evidence based best practice in medicine and, if they don’t already, they should expect evidence based best practice in their leaders.  The only way to get there is to have leaders who are committed to know what that practice is&#8221; (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/10/20/unit-5-understanding-quantitative-research-reports/">Achsah&#8217;s Springs, 2018</a>).</p>
<p>I also wanted to share a response that I provided to a question posed by Charlie Mable &#8220;what happens if incorrect conclusions are drawn from [and reported in] a study?&#8221;</p>
<p>One example of a study that produced and published scientific findings was conducted by Andrew Wakefield in 1998. The title of the study was &#8220;Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children.&#8221; It was published in the Lancet and has since been retraced. This single study caused an epidemic of fear that still shows its effects today. You can find the story behind &#8220;Do vaccines cause autism?&#8221; here <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism">https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism</a>.  This is a great example of what can happen if incorrect conclusions are drawn from a study.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any follow up questions!</p>
