According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) “research design shapes how the data are collected, analyzed, reported, and interpreted” for both quantitative and qualitative research (p. 195). Methods and results section in a quantitative study include “numeric scores for variables from a large number of individuals, sites or time points” (p. 193). Qualitative studies include “text and images gathered from a small number of individuals or sites. The text and image analysis of the data is used to develop and report description and themes. The results are interpreted in terms of their overall meaning” (p. 287).&nbsp; In contrast, Quantitative research “uses statistical and graphical analysis of the data to compare groups, relate variables and describe trends. The results are objectively compared with predictions and past studies” (p. 193).

Van Winkle, Allen, DeVore and Winston’s (2014) study was a non-experimental, correlational research design. The authors were measuring the degree of association or relationship between two or more variables using the statistical procedures of correlational analysis (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 204). It can’t be claimed that one variable causes the other, in this example, servant leadership and a followers’ perception of being empowered. &nbsp;According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) correlational research design is one of the most common. Van Winkle et al. (2014) completed good data collection and analysis.&nbsp; The authors used two validated instruments for initial information, then compared the relationship between the two with subsets. Using the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) rating scale for Research Design, the study was assessed at 2.7 out of 3, in the high-quality range (p. 212).

Part B

Van Winkle et al. (2014) sample strategy was two pronged within the 50 employees or less category. Participants were identified either through personal and professional contacts or adult students working for a small business and attending a college in California. The sample strategy was appropriate and justified having 130 out of 156 surveys completed. At an 86% completion rate over the cut off of 60% to be meaningful. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell asserts there is a minimum requirement of 30 participants for a correlational study that relates variables (p. 238).

Van Winkle et al. (2014) used two validated instruments, which they discussed and described, and study was approved by the institutional review board and deemed proper for the data collection.

Internal validity is strong as two instruments were used, one had to be categorized (servant leadership) before comparing the results of the other (followers feeling empowered).&nbsp; It appears that researchers used rigorous procedures to obtain a representative sample so external validity was strong, confirmed with over 86% completion rate of the survey.&nbsp; The overall score using Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell’s rating scale for evaluating the participants and data collection was 2.84 out of 3 (p. 250).

&nbsp;

Part C

“Keep the study’s research questions and hypotheses in mind as you read the results as often the information is organized to address each of these one by one” (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 270).&nbsp; Keeping this in mind, Van Winkle et al. (2014) purpose stated, “this study sought to contribute to the empirical research of servant leadership by measuring the relationship between supervisors’ servant leadership behaviors and followers’ perceptions of empowerment within the context of small business” (Van Winkle et al., 2014). Looking at the data analysis and results, the purpose was fulfilled. The study having a “Crobach alpha of .90 indicates a high internal reliability” (Van Winkle et al., 2014), higher than a reliability score of at least .70 which Plano-Clark and Creswell indicate is one measure for statistical significance (p. 242). The sample size of 116 resulted in a power of 100%, suggesting the “sample size was more than adequate to support the correlation found” (Van Winkle et al., 2014).

Overall findings show “servant leadership behaviors have strong correlations with followers’ perceptions of both structural empowerment and the psychological empowerment of followers” (Van Winkle et al., 2014). The most important results are visually shown in Table 1 broken out into discussion about each individual subscale of follower’s perceived empowerment.

&nbsp;

Part D

One of the most important things to keep in mind in the methods and results section is validating the hypotheses and research questions for the overall study. The methods should be clear and reproducible if the results needed to be validated. The data needs to be thought of in terms of it’s strength with various validating methods such as p value, r, internal and external validation.&nbsp; This assists the reader with what weight to assign the study’s overall conclusions.

Elements of this section regarding a deep understanding of all the statistical measurements are not concrete to me at this point. It helped to go through some of these elements using the specific paper. It is not something to fear, just to be aware of. In my work context, it will make me a more informed and better consumer of research papers and knowing how much emphasis to place on conclusions of the study.

What happens if incorrect conclusions are drawn in a study? Do you think these would have to be mentioned and discredited in the introduction section of subsequent papers or just ignored?
