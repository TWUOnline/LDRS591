<span style="font-weight: 400">As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality qualitative research report is the explanation and justification of a research design. I found it difficult to determine the research design when it was not explicitly stated. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) offer many suggestions for keywords to look for to assist in recognizing the research design used. Chan and So (2017) did not have any of these keywords. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is also important for a research study to be rich in detail, support a full explanation of the research, and provide a discussion of  the final results. This can be done by including tables and figures that provide more detail and clarification of connections between themes. Plano-Clark and Creswell suggest that a the findings should be “rich and detailed so that the reader feels like they were present within the setting.” (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 379). I felt that this research report was somewhat lacking. I did not feel this presence in my reading and found that I had a lot of unanswered question about the research design itself. Chan and So (2017) did provide several themes, sub-themes and an adequate explanation of each theme. I feel that this is important because it helps me to further understand the purpose of the study.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For further comments and discussion, I would like to know if the flexibility of qualitative research procedures impacts the validity of the research?</span>
