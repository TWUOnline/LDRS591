<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Plano-Clark and Creswell suggest that Theory or Concept Sampling is used to “generate a theory or explore a concept.” (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 234). I believe that Chan and So used this method for sampling in their research. They chose a specific group that would help them to generate their theory, which is that servant leadership qualities can develop in adolescents, as well as to develop specific concepts within that theory. I believe that this sampling strategy is appropriate for the research. Plano-Clark and Creswell do state that in “a well-written qualitative report, the researchers should describe and defend the specific type of purposeful sampling strategy that they used in their study.” (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 335). Chan and So (2015) do not justify or provide a clear explanation of the reasoning for the sampling method they have chosen. </span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the sample size appropriate?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest that the sampling size should be as few as one and as many as 30 when studying a classroom as a case study. Chan and So had 11 participants in their study. I believe that this is an appropriate sample size for the classroom as a case. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 336).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the data collected appropriate?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The data was collected in this study through focus-group interviews. The data was then recorded into audio recordings. I feel that the validity and significance of the data collected would be more valuable if Chan and So collected data in different ways as well. They conducted interviews by a main researcher and then the results were coded and categorized. It would be beneficial to include a formal observation analysis or other documented data that would strengthen the results of the research. </span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The data for this research was collected ethically. Chan and So (2017), state “prior to each focus-group interview, interviewees gave their written consent, acknowledging their understanding of this research, agreeing to participate in the interview and giving permission for the audio recording.” (Chan and So, 2017, P 21). Chan and So secured appropriate permissions in their research and treated participants respectfully.</span>
