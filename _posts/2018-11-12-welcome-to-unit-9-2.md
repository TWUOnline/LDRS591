Hi Everyone,

We are near the end of our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of research reports.  This week, in Unit 9, you will be reading about the common elements of a conclusion section of a research report in Chapter 14 of Plano-Clark and Creswell&#8217;s (2015) text.  After you have read the chapter, then you will be working through the last few servant leadership articles to evaluate and interpret the conclusions section of a research report.

Looking ahead, the final assignment &#8220;Formal Literature Review&#8221; is due on December 9th, (two weeks after the course is finished).  Please review the instructions for the final assignment and let me know if you have any questions about it.  I am here to help.

Have a great week!

Dr. Strong
