Would you prioritize research about first nations people done by local authors over the same topic done by outside researchers? What are the advantages and inconveniences of either choice? By E. depressing

I feel qualified to answer the question regarding researching first nations by local authors or by outside researchers. I am a First Nations person and work for my community for the economic arm as described in my opening blog. I will do my best to share my thoughts based on my experience.

Advantages of a local authors:

<ul>
<li>First nations pass down traditional knowledge orally and are careful to share information only with those that are most trusted. There are many examples of local authors that have long standing relationships with indigenous communities and are trusted to share the information respectfully. An example of this type relationship is often with archaeologists. Many communities will work with an archaeologist for their entire career as they are trusted with traditional knowledge and have the best interest of the nation at heart. The archaeologist will also often assist with supporting rights and title and so have quite a bit of experience in conducting research on behalf of a nation.</li>
<li>There are some quality local resources that are great sources. A good place to start is call a local indigenous community and ask if their lands department can recommend some local, credible books. Indigenous lands departments can be a great help, in particular in tracking down older publications.</li>
</ul>

Inconveniences<span style="font-size: 1rem">:</span>

<ul>
<li>The amount indigenous subject matter experts might limit your availability of quality research.</li>
<li>In thinking about rights and title you need to be careful in examining your sources. There is a great deal of misinformation out there that stems from nations wanting to strengthen their rights and title claims. By utilizing an outside researcher you will likely get a more objective viewpoint.</li>
<li>Also be careful that you examine the sources of the researchers. As an indigenous person I often get frustrated with the references and citations even from some of the most qualified researchers. I&#8217;ve seen history change because of propaganda of individuals further their rights and title.</li>
</ul>
