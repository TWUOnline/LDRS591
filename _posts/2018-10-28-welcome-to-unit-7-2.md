This week I have prepared an audio message to introduce you to mixed methods research.  You can listen to my audio message here:

<div class="post-embed"><iframe width="1165" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F398715627&%23038;show_artwork=true&%23038;maxwidth=1165&%23038;maxheight=1000&%23038;dnt=1"></iframe></div>

You can find the video link I talk about in my message here:

<div class="post-video"><iframe width="1165" height="655" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5e7kVzMIfs?wmode=transparent&#038;fs=1"  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<strong>Reminders:  </strong>

At the end of this week your fourth assignment is due (Scholarly Article Critique). You can find the instructions for assignment 4 <a href="https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591/scholarly-article-review-3/">here</a>.  Keep in mind that I am asking you to select one published, peer-reviewed journal article of your choice from your own literature search.  I would recommend that you select an article that is either a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods study because you have experience already evaluating these types of research articles.

In week 8, you will need to create your own audio recording to share your action research idea with your colleagues.  Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on your blog.  You will also be asked to peer-review an action research project. The peer-review partner that you will be evaluating is posted on a link in Moodle under the Assignment drop box tab.

Have a great week!

Dr. Strong
