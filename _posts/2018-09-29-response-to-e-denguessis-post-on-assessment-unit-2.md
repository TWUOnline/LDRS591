<p>I really enjoyed reading both your concept map and your post.  After reading your post, I felt compelled to learn a little bit more about Cameroon. I was saddened to see that there are some warnings posted about the violence that is occurring near its borders. I have friends who have recently left Chad after spending a couple of years there. Your love for Cameroon is palatable in your writing and I can appreciate how you wish to find ways to improve the governance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Would you prioritize research about first nations people done by local authors over the same topic done by outside researchers? What are the advantages and inconveniences of either choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>To answer your question, I believe that as long as the research you are looking at is a first hand account of events and isn&#8217;t secondary in nature, than I believe that both points of view are equally important. It is when we set our own biases aside and view things from the lens and perspective of all sides that we can learn the most about any issue.</p>
