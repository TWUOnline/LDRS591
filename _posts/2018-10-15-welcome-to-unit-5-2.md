<p>In this unit you will be exploring the next major section of a research report:  <em><strong>The methods and results section.</strong></em>  In this unit, we will see that the methods section indicates the <strong>overall plan</strong> for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us.  These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively.  In unit 5 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of <strong>quantitative research reports</strong>.  I just want to remind you that we are <i>reviewing</i> these materials in order to become an <em>informed critical consumer of research</em>, rather than research experts.</p>
<p>Do not let the work that you will be doing in quantitative research reports this week overwhelm you.  I am here to support you and if you have any questions at all or need further explanation of something you read about, please do not hesitate to reach out and contact me.</p>
<p>In addition to your blog post, you also need to submit assignment 3 by next Sunday.  Let me know if you have any questions about this assignment.</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
<p>Dr. Strong</p>
