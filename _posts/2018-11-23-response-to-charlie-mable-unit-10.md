I enjoyed your last paragraph of your post where you discuss what it takes and all the steps involved between pharmaceutical research and products being approved for human consumption in Canada. Your question at the end was psychologically fascinating to me because this course has awakened my need for credible factual information. I have always been (for the most part) a naturally accepting individual and I have turned into this skeptical, question everything &#8216;researcher&#8217;.  Is anything ever fully right or true?  I was genuinely shocked by Ben Goldacre&#8217;s talk and some of the revelations he shared about research reports and the actual credibility of people who report and share incorrect information to large populations of people as being factual. It&#8217;s scary!

My role as a teacher enables me to be viewed as a credible source of information to my students. I feel a huge responsibility to ensure that what I share is free from bias and factual. I want them to question, to be skeptical and to learn what constitutes a reliable source.

Thank you for causing me to reflect so deeply about this!
