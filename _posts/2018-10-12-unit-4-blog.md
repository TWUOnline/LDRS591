<p>Sendjaya, S., &amp; Sarros, J. C. (2002). Servant Leadership: Its Origin, Development, and Application in Organizations. <i>Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies,</i><i>9</i>(2), 57-64. doi:10.1177/107179190200900205</p>

<li><strong>Evaluation of the problem: 2.5/3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sendjaya &amp; Sarros (2002) introduced the topic of servant leadership (SL) by acknowledging that the concept received recognition in “the literature.” (p. 57). They then described the problem as a lack of empirical evidence to support the SL as a theory. The authors justified the importance of the problem and acknowledge its deficiencies by exposing the ambiguity that the nature of the SL causes: “a servant as a leader, and a leader as a servant” (p. 57). Nevertheless, the authors acknowledged the interest of scholarship and demonstrated the need of organization for servant leadership as a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Part B. Evaluation of the Literature Review: 2.2/3</strong></p>
<p>At the exception of three references, the authors included literatures in the leadership field from the past 10 years. 2.5/3</p>
<p>The authors made a good summary and use of the literatures, but they are “not organized into major themes or topics” (Plano &#8211; Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 143) 2/3</p>
<p>The critical examination of the study is average. Although the authors examine the “deficiencies, strengths and weaknesses” (Plano &#8211; Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 143) of the literature. They did not give a substantial explanation for their use of the literature. 1.5/3</p>
<p>The study takes its root from and is informed by literatures. It is evident in statements such as according to, argue, present in the review. 3/3</p>
<p>Although brief, I believe that the literature is in line with the overall approach (qualitative) of the study. It showcased in the use of informative statements.  2/3</p>
<p><strong>Part C.  Evaluation of the Purpose Statement: 2/3</strong></p>
<p>The authors introduced the purpose statement with the statement “the paper explores” (p. 57), signalling to the audience, the focus of the study. (3/3)</p>
<p>The study focusses on the “philosophical basis of servant leadership” (p. 57) which in my opinion is a “broad… concept” (Plano &#8211; Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 185). (3/3)</p>
<p>The authors made it clear that servant leadership is the “phenomena” (Plano &#8211; Clark, 2015, p.147) which informed the central focus (3/3).</p>
<p>The study does not identify any participants, nor sites (0/3). In addition, the purpose is not offered in a form of a hypothesis (quantitative), or questions (qualitative). (0/3).</p>
<p>The purpose derived from the issues and the literature review (3/3), and is consistent with the qualitative approach the writers adopted (2/3).</p>
<p><strong>Part D. Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p>In the introduction section of a research paper, I will need to consider the following details: the topic, the problem, the literature reviews and the purpose. I still struggle to discriminate between the statement of the problem and the topic, especially when it is not obvious.</p>
<p>The present knowledge could facilitate the selection of good resources which in turn could inform decision making and the development of good report; it is also a good strategy to learn how to summarize information for oral or written presentation.</p>
<p>Question: How important is the length of the introduction section in relation to its quality?  Can concepts such as servant leadership which do not have theoretical foundation study empirically?</p>
