I&#8217;m glad to hear that you have previous experience with APA! I really enjoyed reading your post and I also appreciate the suggestions that you have made to improve on APA.  They include:

<ul>
<li>Using peer review, writing partners, using google for synonyms, being factual, using editors. (<a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/10/05/ldrs591-flow-unit-3-blog/">Edenguessi, 2018</a>)</li>
</ul>

Here are my responses to the questions you posted on your blog

<p>What is the requirement in the APA style Dr. Strong would changed, and why?

<ul>
<li><em>I think I would change the formatting of the references in the reference list.</em>  <em>Specifically I would remove the requirement for italics.  I would keep the structure of the references the same in that you would still need to provide the following:</em></li>
<li>Author, A. B. (year). Title of the article or book. Publication Source, Vol. (Issue). Retrieved from http:</li>
<li>The reason I would change this is that it doesn&#8217;t seem to really serve any purpose and it consistently is something that students make mistakes on.</li>
</ul>

Which types of Strategy Dr. Strong have used to become a good writer in the APA tradition?

<ul>
<li><em>I mentioned in <a href="https://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/2018/10/07/response-to-a-walk-in-the-woods/">a response to A Walk in the Woods</a> that I expect students to make many APA mistakes in this course.  I don’t expect everyone to read the APA manual and be able to apply every detail automatically.   What I do expect is that you try to begin applying what you have learned about APA.  You will find with every assignment that you will make APA mistakes, and that is ok.  <strong>I actually find the best way to learn APA is to make mistakes, correct them, and then learn what to do the next time.</strong>  I still make mistakes and I have been working with APA style for 16 years. </em></li>
</ul>

What were Dr. Strong’s indicators of completion for her research paper?

<ul>
<li><em>I&#8217;m going to assume that this question is in reference to completing my dissertation.  If it is, then I would say that I worked closely with my supervisor and I did my best to work on my APA style writing during the writing process.  My supervisor edited each chapter of the document for me.  I had to correct the mistakes.  It was a collaborative process, and I found that this was the best method to learn how to write in APA style.  </em></li>
</ul>

On a scale of 10 where 0 is the lowest and 10 the highest, what was Dr. Strong degree of satisfaction after completing her research paper?

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Definitely a 10.</strong>  It took five years for me to prepare, plan, execute, analyze, write, and present my research for my dissertation.  So my satisfaction with completing a major life goal was definitely a 10.  I also had two small children at the time so it was a balancing act between life and school.</em></li>
</ul>

Thank you for your questions!

Dr. Strong
