I enjoyed reading the blog from awalkinthewoods, Unit 3 assignment. First I&#8217;d like to comment that I like all of the humble responses from all of the students regarding their APA writing experience. The part that I found most interesting about awalkinthewoods post is the experience of attending a speaker event where the speaker provided references for speaking points. We&#8217;ve learned about APA writing but I cannot recall reading about speaking engagements. In any case I do think it it is courteous and professional to give credit in a speaking engagement and can add credibility to the speech. There are some APA rules I can see that might have some relevance such as the section on Permission to Quote, Reprint, or Adapt. &#8220;You may need written permission from the owner or copyrighted work if you include lengthy quotations or if you include reprinted or adapted tables or figures&#8221; (American Psychological Association 2010). Perhaps a little excessive for some audiences however if presented at a major conference where there are a number of subject matter experts its best to air on the side of caution. Thank you awalkinthewoods for sharing this important lesson.
