<strong>Part A</strong>

In both quantitative and qualitative studies, researchers review literature at the beginning of the study’s research process. In the case of quantitative research, researchers use the literature to substantiate the research problem. The literature is then used to prescribe the direction or intent of the study. On the contrary, quantitative research does not focus on the literature to prescribe specific variables or hypotheses, choosing instead to inform the overall approach.

<strong>Evaluating the Statement of Problem in the Research Report:</strong>

Article reviewed is <em>Servant leaders inspire followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization</em> (Hunter et al., 2013). The following is an evaluation of the statement of problem in the research report.

<ol>
<li>The topic is interesting – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; Immediately in the abstract the authors indicate their purpose which was “…to test the relationship between personality, servant leadership, and critical follower and organizational outcomes” (Hunter et. al., 2013, p. 316). The topic is most interesting as there has not been enough research conducted on the effects of a servant leadership style.</li>
<li>The study addresses at least one clear problem – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; Again in the abstract it indicated the “Leader agreeability was positively and extraversion was negatively related to servant leadership, which was associated with decreased follower turnover intentions and disengagement” (Hunter et. al., 2013, p. 316). As well in the introduction the point is made that most research to date has focused on construct development and points to the research studies that support this.</li>
<li>Important of the problem justified – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; Yes, several references are provided to support the evidence of the importance of the problem. These references can be viewed in the Introduction section of the report.</li>
<li>There are deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; In the article the author provides 10 hypothesis to demonstrate that the research is needed and not yet available to support the hypothesis.</li>
<li>There are audiences that can benefit from this knowledge – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; Absolutely the knowledge would be of value to many different audiences. The research is showing that a servant leader can impact company attrition, a more favorable service climate for example.</li>
<li>The passage clearly argues that the study is warranted – Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; yes the introduction describes information currently not available in other research studies and also points out why organizations could benefit from the research.</li>
<li>The passage is well written –Rating 3 Excellent &#8211; I would describe this research study as professionally constructed, east to follow and a fair written report based on the study conducted.</li>
</ol>

Total score is 21 which indicates the report is of high quality.

Overall assessment is that the report is nicely formatted, has excellent evidence why the research was needed and clearly demonstrates that the research is new.

<strong>Part B</strong><strong> </strong>

<strong>Literature review</strong>

Article reviewed is <em>Servant leaders inspire followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization</em> (Hunter et al., 2013). The following is an evaluation of the literature review.

<ol>
<li>The review includes relevant literature – Rating 3 Excellent – the review is comprehensive and includes numerous sources throughout. Every statement is backed by previous literature and references as to where to find the literature.</li>
<li>The review examines sources that are recent and of high quality – Rating 3 Excellent – sources listed are leading researchers known for their work on servant leadership. There are also recent references listed and so yes the sources are up to date.</li>
<li>The literature review is appropriately document – Rating 3 – Excellent – I could not find any errors or omissions with the citations. All appear to be carefully documented.</li>
<li>The literature is thoughtfully synthesized – Rating 3 – Excellent – Yes the literature is organized into major themes and is carefully identified by the use of headings.</li>
<li>The literature is critically examined – Rating 3 – Excellent – the researches included a heading called strengths, limitations and future research and in this section identified issues with potential deficiencies, strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>The study has a strong foundation in literature – Rating 3 – Excellent – the study utilized previous successful methods in conducting its research as well as provided references to previous literature.</li>
<li>The use of the literature fits the study’s overall research approach – Rating 3 – Excellent – Yes the literature justifies the problem and provides major variables. In the introduction it points to the support as to why previous literature is missing information, as well as the report includes 10 hypotheses.</li>
</ol>

Overall score is 21 which means the literature is of high quality. Overall assessment is that the literature provides evidence of lots of previous references where the new research can be built upon.

<strong>Part C</strong>

<strong>Purpose Statements and Research Questions</strong>

Article reviewed is <em>Servant leaders inspire followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization</em> (Hunter et al., 2013). The following is an evaluation of the statement of the purpose statement and research questions.

<ol>
<li>The study’s purpose is clearly specified – Rating 3 Excellent – The abstract clearly states the purpose of the report. Additionally the introduction clearly states the reason why previous reports do not contain information related to the research questions.</li>
<li>The focus of the study is appropriate – Rating 3 Excellent – Yes the focus of the study is clear and concise. The researchers kept the focus clear and examined to major qualities of servant leaders – agreeableness and extraversion versus introversion personalities.</li>
<li>The overall intention of the study is appropriate – Rating 3 Excellent – The intent is precise and to the point. It outlines what studies have focused on to date and what this particular research will focus on and what gaps the research will serve to answer.</li>
<li>The participants and sites are appropriate – Rating 3 Excellent – the people identified completing the surveys were clearly identified. So too were their demographics as well as possible deficiencies or impacts to the outcomes were identified.</li>
<li>The purpose is narrowed through appropriate research questions and or/hypotheses – Rating 3 Excellent – yes each hypothesis explained the theory and why the theory was appropriate to the study.</li>
<li>The purpose follows logically from the statement of the problem and literature review – Rating 3 Excellent – The hypothesis indicated what outcome the research team was wanting to learn more about. Additionally the hypothesis utilized previous research study methodologies.</li>
<li>The purpose is consistent with the study’s overall approach – Rating 3 Excellent – the research questions and hypothesis were narrow and specific, based on literature and applicable theory, predetermined and remain fixed during the study. The questions asked of the participants were based on previous research questions.</li>
</ol>

The overall score is 21 – High quality. The report was a qualitative report based on specific questions that were formulated from previous research. Findings of the research were supported by providing statistics and correlations.

<strong>Part D</strong>

The most important points one needs to consider for determining if a research report is of high quality includes

<ul>
<li>Credibility of researchers</li>
<li>Previous research on the top with list of literature references</li>
<li>APA formatted and published report.</li>
<li>Headings and well-structured report</li>
<li>Evidence of new problems presented and lack of knowledge</li>
<li>Indication of gaps in research and where more knowledge in the future is needed.</li>
<li>References and citations included</li>
</ul>

The information prior to working on Unit 4 that I was aware important to identify if the research is well written is the essentially the same principles applied to any style of writing. A credible author with respected knowledge on the top. The information is organized in a well thought out manner and that any information that has the backing of previous research be included and given proper credit for. New information or knowledge gained includes the formatting specific to APA style writing and that like most written documents, you need to capture the reader’s attention immediately to encourage them to read on. Perhaps one new concept is the indication in the research regarding the gaps in the research and where further research can be conducted. While this was news to me that this is something that should be included in all research reports, intuitively I believe that most human beings have a bit of skepticism and would more likely support the research if the flaws were included.

The information that was easy to remember and learn was related to the writing style of a research study. It would seem logical that a well thought out research question, with justification as to why the new knowledge is needed as well as including this information in an organized fashion, would be appealing to a reader. Answering the who, what, why, when is part of human curiosity and would serve well in a research paper as it does in any written material. The part difficult to remember is the APA reference formatting. There are a number of different accepted rules to follow which is important to get correct. It certainly helps having a guidebook to reference, particularly when there is a type of formatting not regularly used. It’s this attention to detail that takes time and patience, as well as a lot of proof reading. While this is perhaps the most tedious and difficult part it is important to give credit for previous knowledge. Sufficient time should clearly be allocated for reviewing and editing references and citations.

In considering my current roll and applying the knowledge gained, the APA style of writing can be adapted to many types of written reports. It’s important to sometimes slow down writing and carefully consider any points wanted to get across. In providing previous knowledge and evidence it is much easier to instill change to the most skeptic reader. It also shows a level of respect to those being given credit for previous knowledge.

Putting out a quality research paper obviously takes time and patience. In a business setting and in considering a major organizational shift or change, how much time on average do you think should be dedicated toward putting together a quality research paper?
