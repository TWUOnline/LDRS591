<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">After completing this course, I feel that I have been given many tools to increase the level of skepticism and critical thinking that I use when reading research. I believe that there is always a chance that what we are reading may not be credible and there is no sure way of knowing that something is 100% trustworthy. As said in the unit 10 notes, there is always a chance of error in someones research and in the peer review process. Throughout the course, we have learned ways of ensuring that our research is more likely to be trustworthy. Some of these tools include the charts found in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2017) that provide us with templates to help us evaluate research. PLano-Clark and Creswell (2017) are very good at providing indicators of high quality and low quality research. One specific tool that I found helpful was the tips that are offered throughout Plano-Clark and Creswell (2017). The ‘tips’ section often include specific wording to look for, as well as where to look for the wording in a research paper. Another tool is to look up articles online to determine how many times the articles have been cited in other research. The more an article has been cited, the more it has been trusted by other researchers, giving it more credibility. </span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">We have been given tools to determine whether or not research has been performed competently. The templates used throughout the course are designed to be implemented with any piece of research in order to determine the quality of it. It is up to the consumer to critically analyze the research to determine if there are any bias’, flaws in the design or important components of the research that are missing. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">How do I know the research is reported honestly?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">To know if the research is reported honestly, I believe that a consumer must look at the method in which the research was conducted and critically assess to determine if the research was conducted ethically and fairly and is consistent with all participants. One must also look at how the participants were chosen. If there are any clues as to unethical research or a bias sample selection, the consumer should go deeper into research and find other, similar research to ensure that the findings are honest and reliable. If the results have been replicated in another study by different researchers, one can assume the study is credible.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers would conclude?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This is up to the consumer to determine if the research is consistent with other findings. In order to find this out, a good initial step would be to look at the reference list and read the articles referenced by the author. A consumer can also look online to see if the article has been cited elsewhere and then read the articles in which it was cited. To ensure that the findings presented are consistent with other research, it is up to the consumer to complete a thorough amount of research and too be knowledgeable in other, similar studies that have been done. </span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It is important to learn to critically assess and analyze any research conducted. To further the research in any given area, one must be able to read the research, give it some thought, take a step back, and think about how it could have been done differently. Do you think you have to be an expert in the particular subject matter? I do not. It is important to approach research with an open mind. I think I have been taught the critical skills to assess research. I don&#8217;t believe that I have all of the answers, but I believe that my assessment of any research would provide beneficial feedback for further consideration.</span></li>
