<strong>Part A</strong>

The topic I will investigate focusses on creating an inviting environment for ESL leader’s professional Development.

First generation immigrants often face professional barrier because of their inability to be proficient in the language of their new home countries. The barriers are often self-generated but mostly motivated by the perception of others. To solve the challenge, some attend schools or workshops gear to upgrade their verbal communication skills. The result of these upgrades often leads to work acquisitions or higher professional responsibilities. Yet, the reality demonstrates that immigrants often represent the lowest level of staffing in organizations structure. When some succeed to break the glass ceiling, they find it challenging to make presentations, facilitate discussions, defend positions which often hinders their credibility as leaders, and prevent them from aspiring to leadership and executive roles, especially when the organizational culture lack compassion.

I chose to investigate this topic because it reflects the reality I have faced in my journey of employment in the west coast of Canada. I have always found myself in situations where I had to prove that I am a leader and sometimes against work environment which employment strategies encouraged the recruitment of immigrants to fill front line staffing roles.
