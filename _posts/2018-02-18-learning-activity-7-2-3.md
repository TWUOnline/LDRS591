</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To enhance both reliability and validity, the current study employed a mixed method approach of conducting research. The strength of a mixed-method design is through implementing the best features of both types of data collection. The purpose of using a mixed-method design was to enhance confidence in the findings rather than using a single methodology. When conclusions support data collected from multiple sources, validity is enhanced. (Black G. L., 2013, P 446).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The mixed methods design in this research is appropriate. In this study, the mixed methods design combines the strengths of qualitative and quantitative data to increase the validity of the results. The mixed methods design also allows the researcher to build on the initial results to obtain more detailed and specific information, which Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest as an appropriate reason for using mixed methods results. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 386). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Black explains the mixed methods design and the tools that were used in the research in the introduction and then proceeds to justify the need for a mixed methods design in the methods section. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest that it should be explicitly articulated as to why either quantitative or qualitative research alone is inadequate and that the research must provide a sound reason to justify the use of mixed methods. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, P 405).  Black justifies the need for the mixed methods design, “quantitative data provides for generalizability, whereas qualitative data offers information about the context or setting.” (Black G. L., 2013, P 446). </span>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">What were the results of the study?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Black’s (2013) study found the following:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The overall canonical correlation analysis, which combined the teachers and principals in the same analysis, reported a significant positive relationship between the perceptions of servant leadership practices and perceptions of school climate. The strong relationship suggests that when servant leadership 460 Catholic Education / June 2010 is perceived to be present, the perceptions of the school climate are positive. (Black, G. L., 2013, P 459-460).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study’s purpose?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of combining the data was to add depth to the findings in the quantitative data. The results added confidence to the original data. (Black. G.L., 2012, P 459). The use of mixed methods research provided a more in-depth analysis of the problem. The findings are in-depth and answer the questions of the research. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 405).</span>
