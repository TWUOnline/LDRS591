Achsahs Springs’ Action Research Plan aimed to test the effectiveness of peer meeting on the development of accountability, to respond to the lack of management training in her context.  Six participants will be involved in a mixed method study to measure confidence and competence and explore areas for growth. The hope is to create a better working environment for all workers in her field.

The introduction demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the issue at stake. The presentation took the problem and narrowed it into specifics. A logical and smooth transition led to a purpose statement, and a research method follow.  The plan did not identify the research as a mixed design, but the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches for data collections and analyses made it obvious. The method draws on participants and a book to provide data; and the project called for bold actions. The  Video delivery captured the attention and the communication was clear.

After the excellent presentation, I kept wondering: how does this brilliant plan move from a group of six people to an entire department or organization? How does the plan ensure confidentiality and freedom of participation? What department should authorize the peer group study?

Overall, excellent content and delivery.
