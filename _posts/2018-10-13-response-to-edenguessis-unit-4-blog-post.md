<blockquote>Question: How important is the length of the introduction section in relation to its quality?</p></blockquote>

I appreciated your comment referencing the difficulty you were having discriminating between the topic and the statement of the problem.  I too find the introduction part to be challenging. I continually kept referencing Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015)  as I read through the articles. I especially like the image they have on page 82 that details the topic, the research problem and the purpose by asking specific questions that relate to each section.
