Evaluation of podcast from <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-8/">https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-8/</a>

As I have come to expect from the author of &#8220;A Walk in the Woods&#8221;, my overall impression of this presentation is excellent.  The action research plan exceeds the expectations as outlined and is very well developed and articulated.

The project focuses on a real problem in practice and is well supported by both experiential evidence as well as research evidence.  The researcher clearly outlines how she plans to collaborate with other members of her work community to study the effects of the existing mentorship program in her school district and to explore areas for improvement.  The introductory paragraphs provide an in-depth understanding, and it is evident that there has been very careful and thorough reflection about the problem.  The researcher outlines how she plans to gather both quantitative survey data as well as qualitative data.  The plan of action is very clear and includes reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information in order to provide a plan of action for administrators.  If action is taken the results will enhance the lives of new teachers and by inference, the lives of their students.

Though there is nothing missing from the presentation, there are two possible suggestions to improve clarity for the listener.  First, the presentation begins with a question, and includes two subsequent questions within the body of the presentation.  As someone inexperienced in research I encountered some confusion as I wasn&#8217;t certain which question, if any, was the research question.  Second, although I believe it is inferred and present, there is no clear identification of the action&#8211;&gt;reflection&#8211;&gt;action continued or modified&#8211;&gt;new focus cycle.  This is not required, just a possible suggestion for clarity.

Thank you again for the pleasure and privilege of learning from you.

P.S.  Excellent reading voice &#8211; lots of expression!
