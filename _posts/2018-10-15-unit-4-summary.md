In Unit 4 we focused on understanding the common elements found in the introduction of research reports. We examined the differences between qualitative and quantitative research and looked at the differences between the  research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose. Although the terms “research problem” and “research purpose” sound similar, they are in fact quite different.

I think most of you mentioned that reading the introduction section with a set of evaluative questions has given you a new perspective on what you are reading and what to look for.  Edenguessi mentions in his <a href="https://create.twu.ca/edenguessi/2018/10/12/ldrs-591-flow-unit-4-blog/">blog post</a> that &#8220;I still struggle to discriminate between the statement of the problem and the topic, especially when it is not obvious&#8221;.  Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) have provided a really helpful diagram that A Walk in the Woods highlights in a response to Edenguessi&#8217;s post <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/response-to-edenguessis-blog-post/">here.</a>

<ul>
<li>The topic of the article is very general and can be found by asking the question: what is the study about?</li>
<li>In order to find out what the research problem is, you can ask: what problem is the author claiming needs to be addressed or solved?</li>
<li>In order to find the research purpose, you can ask: what does the researcher intend to do?</li>
</ul>

If you keep these three questions front and centre in your mind as you are reading through abstracts and introduction sections of a research report you should be able to identify what the study is about and what the researcher intends to do.  For further tips on how to read a research article, here is a short video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKxm2HF_-k0">How to Read an Academic Paper.</a>

Other learners mentioned this week that they were &#8220;surprised to learn how many elements are included in the introduction. I thought it was just an introduction to the topic that was researched&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/charliemable/2018/10/12/unit-4-research-reports/">(Charlie Mable)</a>.

&#8220;Prior to this week, I didn’t know what elements were supposed to be in the introduction.  I do read clinical and leadership research reports in my workplace, but I have always just assumed that they were high quality&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/achsahs-springs/2018/10/13/unit-4-an-introduction-to-research-reports/">(Achsah&#8217;s Springs)</a>.

One other comment that was made this week was &#8220;I felt like I was the least qualified person to rate someone else’s scholarly paper when I know so little about writing them&#8221; <a href="https://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/unit-4-assessment/">(A Walk in the Woods)</a>.

Let me close this post by saying that it is likely that you are not an expert on the topic of servant leadership&#8230;.yet!  Therefore, it will be challenging at first to evaluate the articles that you are reading.  You are becoming familiar with not only the structure of a research article, but also the topic of servant leadership &#8211; how it is defined, measured, and analyzed.  Many people read research articles and believe that they are high quality because they have been written by an academic, they are published in a peer-reviewed journal, they use a lot of technical language and the article is very, very long.  Unfortunately, this is only a surface level evaluation. What most people are lacking are the tools to critically evaluate research articles section by section.  That is where this course comes in &#8211; think about this course as providing you with a new set of lenses to see/read/evaluate research one week and one section at a time. Be patient and gracious with yourself, this process will take time, but it definitely help you become a more informed critical consumer of research.
