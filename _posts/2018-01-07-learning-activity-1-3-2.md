<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The authors of these articles conceptualize “evidence” as the results of research. They conceptualize evidence-based leadership as a challenging, yet highly reliable means of leadership. Evidence based research helps to minimize the human error in that one&#8217;s perception  of a situation and how to handle it, can differ from the actual reality of the situation. Evidence based research removes the human bias; and therefore in theory provides more accurate information, resulting in better decision making.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The greater number of supporting sources for a “lesson learned,” the more rigorous the supporting evidence, and the greater the triangulation of supporting sources, the more confidence one has in the significance and meaningfulness of a lesson learned.” (Patton, P 335, 2001). Patton explains that evidence based research is more reliable than research that is not evidence based. He states that “lessons learned with only one type of supporting evidence are a, “lessons learned hypothesis.” (Patton, P 335, 2001). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walshe and Rundall state that “evidence-based health care is, at its simplest, the idea that the care that health professionals provide should be based as closely as possible on evidence from well-conducted research into the effectiveness of health care interventions, thereby minimizing the problems of underuse, overuse, and misuse.” (Walshe and Rundall, P 431, 2001). They further explain how difficult this is in the medical field as the volume of research that is available is unending. This creates many difficulties and requires an excellent means of knowledge management within health-care organizations. (Walshe and Rundall, 2001). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trybus explains that evidence based research is “research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs.&#8221; (Trybus, M. P 5, 2007). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree with the authors, in that evidence-based decision making is a reliable, and more effective means of making decisions. Although I believe that while evidence-based research is reliable, one still needs to critically assess the results of the research in practical terms. If research provides a person with strong evidence that contradicts his/her own personal values, he/she should still make the decision based on the evidence as it is backed by research and is based on facts, rather than personal bias. </span></p>
